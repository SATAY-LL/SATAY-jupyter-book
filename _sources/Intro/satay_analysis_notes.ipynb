    "(sterility).\n",
    "(Non)-essentiality of genes is not constant over different genetic backgrounds, but genes can gain or lose essentiality when other genes are mutated.\n",
    "Moreover, it is expected that the interactions between genes changes in mutants (changes in the interaction map).\n",
    "This raises a number of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *If there exists a relation between genes which gain or lose essentiality after mutations and the changes in the interaction map?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a gene x gains or loses essentiality after a mutation in gene y, does the essentiality of gene y also changes if a mutation in gene x is provoked?\n",
    "\n",
    "- After a mutation that reduces the fitness of a population of cells, the population is sometimes able to increase its fitness by mutating other genes (e.g. dBem1 eventually result in mutations in Bem3).\n",
    "Can these mutations, that are initiated by cells themselves, be predicted based on the interaction maps (i.e. predict survival of the fittest)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a gene x is suppressed, it will possibly change the essentiality of another gene.\n",
    "It is expected that most changes in essentiality will occur in the same subnetwork of the mutated gene.\n",
    "If a gene y is suppressed that is part of the same network as gene x, does this invoke similar changes in this subnetwork?\n",
    "In other words, are there common changes in the subnetwork when a random change is made within this subnetwork?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there relations between the changes in the interaction network after a mutation and the Genetic Ontology (GO-)terms of changed genes?\n",
    "\n",
    "To check the essentiality of genes, SATAY (SAturated Transposon Analysis in Yeast) experiments will be performed on different genetic backgrounds [Michel et.al., 2017] [Segal et.al., 2018].\n",
    "This uses transposons to inhibit genes and it allows to compare the effects of this inhibition on the fitness of the cells (see for example the [galaxyproject website](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/tnseq/tutorial.html) which explains it in the context of bacteria, but the same principles hold for yeast cells).\n",

    "- Transposons are small pieces of DNA that can integrate in a random location in the genome.\n",
    "When the insertion happens at the location of a gene, this gene will be inhibited (i.e. it can still be transcribed, but typically it cannot be translated into a functional protein).\n",
    "\n",
    "- After a transposon is randomly inserted in the DNA, the growth of the cell is checked.\n",
    "- If the cell cannot produce offspring, the transposon has likely been inserted in an essential gene or genomic region.\n",
    "- This is done for many cells at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the cells are let to grow after insertion and the cells that have a transposon inserted in an essential part of their DNA (therefore having a low fitness) will, after some time, be outcompeted by the cells with an insertion in a non-essential part of the DNA (cells with a relatively high fitness).\n",
    "By means of sequencing, the location of the transposon insertion can be checked and related to a specific gene.\n",
    "Since the cells that have an essential part of the genome blocked do not occur in the population, those cells are not sequenced and hence the location of the transposon in these cells are missing in the sequencing results.\n",
    "Thus, when the sequencing results of all the cells are aligned to a reference genome, some genomic locations are missing in the sequencing results.\n",
    "These missing locations corresponds to potentially essential genomic regions.\n",
    "The genome of all cells (called the library) is saturated when all possible insertion sites have at least one insertion of a transposon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case all regions of the DNA are checked for their essentiality.\n",

    "## Gene Essentiality\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentiality of genes are defined as its deletion is detrimental to cell in the form that either the cell cannot grow anymore and dies, or the cell cannot give rise to offspring. Essentiality can be grouped in two categories, namely type I and type II [Chen et.al. 2016].\n",
    "- Type I essential genes are genes, when inhibited, show a loss-of-function that can only be rescued (or masked) when the lost function is recovered by a gain-of-function mechanism.\n",
    "- Typically these genes are important for some indispensable core function in the cell (e.g. Cdc42 in *S. Cerevisiae* that is type I essential for cell polarity).\n",
    "- Type II essential genes are the ones that look essential upon inhibition, but the effects of its inhibition can be rescued or masked by the deletion of (an)other gene(s).\n",
    "- These genes are therefore not actually essential, but when inhibiting the genes some toxic side effects are provoked that are deleterious for the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that the essentiality of genes (both type I and type II), may change between different genetic backgrounds.\n",
    "For changes in essentiality four cases are considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A gene is **essential** in WT and remains **essential** in the\n",
    "    mutant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A gene is **non-essential** in WT and remains **non-essential** in\n",
    "    the mutant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A gene is **essential** in WT and becomes **non-essential** in the\n",
    "    mutant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A gene is **non-essential** in WT and becomes **essential** in the\n",
    "    mutant.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is given in the figure below, where an interaction map is\n",
    "shown for WT cells and a possible interaction map for a mutant where\n",
    "both the essentiality and the interactions are changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example interaction network for a WT cell and a mutant with essential and non-essential genes.](./media/example_interaction_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation 1 and 3 are expected to be the trickiest since those ones are difficult to validate.\n",
    "To check the synthetic lethality in cells, a double mutation needs to be made where one mutation makes the genetic background and the second mutation should confirm whether the second mutated gene is actually essential or not.\n",
    "This is typically made by sporulating the two mutants, but deleting a gene that is already essential in wild type prevents the cell from growing or dividing and can therefore not be sporulated with the mutant to create the double deletion.\n",
    "Therefore, these double mutants are hard or impossible to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point to be aware of is that some genes might be essential in specific growth conditions (see also the subsection).\n",
    "For example, cells that are grown in an environment that is rich of a specific nutrient, the gene(s) that are required for the digestion of this nutrient might be essential in this condition.\n",
    "The SATAY experiments will therefore show that these genes are intolerant for transposon insertions.\n",
    "However, when the cells are grown in another growth condition where mainly other nutrients are present, the same genes might now not be essential and therefore also be more tolerant to transposon insertions in that region.\n",
    "It is suggested to compare the results of experiments with cells from the same genetic background grown in different conditions with each other to rule out conditions specific results.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to check the essentiality of all genes in different mutants and compare this with both wild type cells and with each other.\n",
    "The goal is to make an overview of the changes in the essentiality of the genes and the interaction network between the proteins.\n",
    "With this we aim to eventually be able to predict the synthetic lethality of multiple mutations based on the interaction maps of the individual mutations.\n",

    "## Interpreting Transposon Counts & Reads\n",
    "\n",
    "Once cells have a transposon inserted somewhere in the DNA, the cells are let to grow so they can potentially generate a few new generations.\n",
    "A cell with a transposon inserted in an essential part of its DNA grows very slowly or might not grow at all (due to its decreased fitness).\n",
    "Since the sequencing starts only at the location of a transposon insertion (see experimental methods section), it can be concluded that roughly each read from the sequencing corresponds with a transposon insertion (roughly mainly because transposon inserted in essential genes can generate no reads).\n",
    "Cells with a transposon inserted in an essential genomic region, will not have divided and therefore will not have a contribution to the sequencing reads.\n",
    "When the reads are aligned to a reference sequence and the number of reads are mapped against the genome, empty regions indicate possible essential genes.\n",
    "Negative selection can thus be found by looking for empty regions in the reads mapping.\n",
    "When a transposon is inserted in a non-essential genomic region, these cells can still divide and give rise to offspring and after sequencing the non-essential regions will be represented by relatively many reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "During processing the genes can be analysed using the number of transposon insertions per gene (or region) or the number of reads per gene.\n",
    "Reads per gene, instead of transposons per gene, might be a good measure for positive selection since it is more sensitive (bigger difference in number of reads between essential and non-essential genes), but also tends to be nosier.\n",
    "Transposons per gene is less noisy, but is also less sensitive since the number of transposons inserted in a gene does not change in subsequent generations of a particular cell.\n",
    "Therefore it is hard to tell the fitness of cells when a transposon is inserted a non-essential region solely based on the number of transposon insertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally only the transposons inserted in non-essential genomic regions will have reads (since only these cells can create a colony before sequencing), creating a clear difference between the essential and non-essential genes.\n",
    "However, sometimes non-essential genes also have few or no transposon insertion sites.\n",
    "According to [Michel et.al.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/23570) this can have 3 main reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During alignment of the reads, the reads that represent repeated DNA sequences are discarded, since there is no unique way of fitting them in the completed sequence.\n",
    " (Although the DNA sequence is repeated, the number of transposon counts can differ between the repeated regions)\n",
    " Transposons within such repeated sequences are therefore discarded and the corresponding reads not count.\n",
    " If this happens at a non-essential gene, it appears that it has no transposons, but this is thus merely an alignment related error in the analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Long stretches of DNA that are without stop codons, called Open Reading Frames (ORF), typically code for proteins.\n",
    " Some dubious ORF might overlap with essential proteins, so although these ORF themselves are not essential, the overlapping part is and therefore they do not show any transposons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some genes are essential only in specific conditions.\n",
    " For example, genes that are involved in galactose metabolism are typically not essential, as inhibition of these genes block the cell’s ability to digest galactose, but it can still survive on other nutrition’s.\n",
    " In lab conditions however, the cells are typically grown in galactose rich media, and inhibiting the genes for galactose metabolism cause starvation of the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A gene might not be essential, but its deletion might cripple the cell so that the growth rate decreases significantly.\n",
    " When the cells are grown, the more healthy cells grow much faster and, after some time, occur more frequently in the population than these crippled cells and therefore these cells might not generate many reads or no reads at all.\n",
    " In the processing, it might therefore look as if these genes are essential, but in fact they are not.\n",
    " The cells just grow very slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way around might also occur, where essential genes are partly tolerant to transposons.\n",
    "This is shown by Michel et.al. to be caused that some regions (that code for specific subdomains of the proteins) of the essential genes are dispensable.\n",
    "The transposons in these essential genes are clearly located at a specific region in the gene, the one that codes for a non-essential subdomain.\n",
    "However, this is not always possible, as in some cases deletion of non-essential subdomains of essential genes create unstable, unexpressed or toxin proteins.\n",
    "The difference in essentiality between subdomains in a single protein only happens in essential genes, not in non-essential genes.\n",
    "Michel et.al. devised an algorithm to estimate the likelihood $L$ of a gene having an essential subdomain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = \\frac{\\text{d }N_{\\text{cds}}}{l_{\\text{cds}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d$ is the longest interval (in terms of base pairs) between 5 neighbouring transposons in a Coding DNA Sequence (cds) ($\\geq 300$ bp), $N_{cds}$ is the total number transposons mapping in the cds ($\\geq 20$) transposons) and $l_{cds}$ is the total length of the CDS.\n",
    "Additionally, it must hold that $0.1 l_{cds} \\leq d \\leq 0.9 l_{cds}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that only essential genes carry essential subdomains, and indeed what was found by Michel et.al. that the genes with the highest likelihood were mostly also genes previously annotated as essential by other studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the reasons mentioned before, not a simple binary conclusion can be made solely based on the amount of transposon insertions or the number of reads.\n",
    "Instead, a gene with little reads *might* be essential, but to be sure the results from other experiments need to be implemented as well, for example where the cells were grown in a different growth conditions.\n",
    "Therefore, SATAY analysis only says something about the relative fitness of cells where a specific gene is inhibited in the current growth conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods and File types\n",
    "\n",
    "Many essential genes in wild type cells are already known and published.\n",
    "The results from our SATAY experiments we can verify using the known essential genes and check how well they fit with the number of reads in each gene.\n",
    "Also, we can use a similar approach as was performed by the Kornmann lab [Michel et.al. 2017] using wild type cells. \n",
    "Comparison of our results with those obtained by the Kornmann lab might confirm the quality of our experimental and analysis methods.\n",
    "Once our experimental method is verified, we want to compare the differences in essentiality of genes in wild type with different mutants (e.g. dBem1, dBem2, dBem3 and dNrp1).\n",
    "For fast processing of many experimental results, a tool needs to be developed that automatically converts the raw sequencing data to a list of the number of transposons and reads for each gene, and potentially list some of their properties (e.g. essentiality, GO-terms, interactions etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{toggle} To get the a summary of the experimental method, click the buttom to reveal :) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of SATAY starts with inserting a plasmid in the cells that contains a transposase (TPase) and the transposon (MiniDs) flanked on both sides by adenine (ADE).\n",
    "The transposon has a specific, known, sequence that codes for the transposase that cuts the transposon from the plasmid (or DNA) to (another part of) the DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Simplified example for the transposon insertion plasmid.](./media/Plasmid_transposon.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The MiniDs transposon is cut loose from the plasmid and randomly inserted in the DNA of the host cell.\n",
    "If the transposon is inserted in a gene, the gene can still be transcribed by the ribosomes, but typically cannot be (properly)\n",
    "translated in a functional protein.\n",
    "The genomic DNA (with the transposon) is cut in pieces for sequencing using enzymes, for example DpnII.\n",
    "This cuts the DNA in many small pieces (e.g. each 75bp long) and it always cuts the transposon in two parts (i.e. digestion of the DNA).\n",
    "Each of the two halves of the cut transposon, together with the part of the gene where the transposon is inserted in, is ligated meaning that it is folded in a circle.\n",
    "A part of the circle is then the half transposon and the rest of the circle is a part of the gene where the transposon is inserted in.\n",
    "Using PCR and primers, this can then be unfolded by cutting the circle at the halved transposon.\n",
    "The part of the gene is then between the transposon quarters.\n",
    "Since the sequence of the transposon is known, the part of the gene can be extracted.\n",
    "This is repeated for the other half of the transposon that includes the other part of the gene.\n",
    "When both parts of the gene are known, the sequence from the original gene can be determined.\n",

    "## Sequence alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the order of nucleotides in a genome, shotgun sequencing is used where the genome is cut is small pieces called reads (typically tens to a few hundred basepairs long).\n",
    "The reads have overlapping regions that can be used to identify their location with respect to a reference genome and other reads (i.e. mapping of the reads).\n",
    "Mapping of the reads result in contigs, which are multiple mapped reads that form continuous assembled parts of the genome (contigs can be the entire target genome itself).\n",
    "All contigs should be assembled to form (a large part of) the target genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence assembly problem can be described as: *Given a set of sequences, find the minimal length string containing all members of the set as substrings*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reads from the sequencing can be single-end or paired-end, which indicates how the sequencing is performed.\n",
    "In paired-end sequencing, the reads are sequenced from both directions, making the assembly easier and more reliable, but results in twice as many reads as single-end reads.\n",
    "The reason of the more reliable results has to do with ambiguous reads that might occur in the single-end sequencing.\n",
    "Here, a read can be assigned to two different locations on the reference genome (and have the same alignment score).\n",
    "In these cases, it cannot be determined where the read should actually be aligned (hence its position is ambiguous).\n",
    "In paired-end sequencing, each DNA fragment has primers on both ends, meaning that the sequencing can start in both the 5’-3’ direction and in the 3’-5’ direction.\n",
    "Each DNA fragment therefore has two reads both which have a specified length that is shorter than the entire DNA fragment.\n",
    "This results that a DNA fragment is read on both ends, but the central part will still be unknown (as it is not covered by these two particular reads, but it will be covered by other reads).\n",
    "Since you know that the two reads belong close together, the alignment of one read can be checked by the alignment of the second read (or paired mate) somewhere in close vicinity on the reference sequence.\n",
    "This is usually enough for the reads to become unambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting data from the sequencing is stored in a FASTQ file where all individual reads are stored including a quality score of the sequencing.\n",
    "The reads are in random order and therefore the first step in the processing is aligning of the reads in the FASTQ files with a reference genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the quality of the reads typically decreases near the 3'-end of the reads due to the chemistry processes required for sequencing (this depends on the kind of method used).\n",
    "For Illumina sequencing, the main reasons are signal decay and dephasing, both causing a relative increase in the background noise.\n",
    "Dephasing occurs when a DNA fragment is not de-blocked properly.\n",
    "A DNA fragment is copied many times and all copies incorporate a fluorescent nucleotide that can be imaged to identify the nucleotide.\n",
    "If there are 1000 copies of the DNA fragment, there are 1000 fluorescent nucleotides that, ideally, are all the same to create a high quality signal.\n",
    "After imaging, the DNA fragment is de-blocked to allow a new fluorescent nucleotide to bind.\n",
    "This deblocking might not work for all copies of the DNA fragment.\n",
    "For example, 100 copies might not be deblocked properly, so for the next nucleotide only 900 copies agree for the next incorporated nucleotide.\n",
    "For the third round, the 100 copies that were not deblocked properly in the second round, might now be deblocked as well, but now they are lagging behind one nucleotide, meaning that in the coming rounds they have consistently the wrong nucleotide.\n",
    "As the reads increases in length, more rounds are needed and therefore the chances of dephasing increases causing a decrease in the quality of the reads.\n",
    "This gives noise in the signal of the new nucleotide and therefore the quality of the signal decreases.\n",
    "For example, take the next 6bp sequence that is copied 5 times:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `GATGTC`\n",
    "2. `GATGTC`\n",
    "3. `G ATGT`\n",
    "4. `GAT GT`\n",
    "5. `G AT G`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two reads are deblocked properly and they give all the right nucleotides.\n",
    "But the third and fourth have one round that is not deblocked properly (indicated by the empty region between the nucleotides), hence the nucleotide is always lagging one bp after the failed deblocking.\n",
    "The fifth copy has two failed deblocking situations, hence is lagging two bp.\n",
    "The first nucleotide is a G for all 5 copies, therefore the quality of this nucleotide is perfect.\n",
    "But, by the end of the read, only two out of five copies have the correct bp (i.e. a C), therefore the quality is poor for this nucleotide.\n",
    "(It can either be a C or a T with equal likelyhood or potentially a G, so determining which nucleotide is correct is ambiguous without knowing which reads are lagging, which you don't know).\n",

    "To check this method, the transposon count for wild type cells are determined.\n",

    "In this figure, both the reads and the transposon counts are normalized with respect to the length of each gene (hence the graph represents the read density and transposon density).\n",
    "High transposon counts only occurs for non-essential genes, and therefore when a high transposon count is seen, it can be assigned nonessential with reasonable certainty.\n",
    "However, when the transposon count is low the there is a significant overlap between the two distributions and therefore there is no certainty whether this gene is essential or not (see also the section about 'Interpreting Transposon Counts & Reads').\n",

    "The data is also sensitive to postprocessing.\n",
    "It is expected that the trimming of the sequences is an important step.\n",
    "The graph below shows the same data as in the previous graph, but with different processing as is done by Michel et. al..\n",
    "This has a significant influence on the results and as a consequence, no distinction can be made between essential and nonessential genes based on the transposon counts.\n",

    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the sequencing is typically represented in FASTA or FASTQ format.\n",
    "This needs to be aligned according to a reference sequence to create a SAM and BAM file.\n",
    "Before alignment, the data needs to be checked for quality and possibly trimmed to remove unwanted and unnecessary sequences.\n",
    "When the location of the reads relative to a reference sequence are known, the insertion sites of the transposons can be determined.\n",
    "With this, a visualization can be made that shows the number of transposon insertions per gene.\n",

    "In the description given in this document, it is chosen to do the quality checking and the trimming in windows and the alignment of the reads with a reference genome in a virtual machine running Linux.\n",
    "It is possible to do the quality checking and trimming in Linux as well or to do the whole process in windows.\n",
    "To do quality checking and/or trimming in Linux requires more memory of the Linux machine since both the raw sequencing data needs to be stored and the trimming needs to be stored (both which can be relatively large files).\n",
    "Since a virtual machine is used, both the computation power and the amount of storage is limited, and therefore it chosen to do the trimming on the main windows computer (this problem would not exists if a computer is used running on Linux, for example a computer with an alternative startup disc running Linux).\n",
    "Sequence alignment can be done on Windows machines (e.g. using [BBmap](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/)), but this is not ideal as many software tools are designed for Unix based computer systems (i.e. Mac or Linux).\n",
    "Also, many tools related to sequence alignment (e.g. converting .sam files to .bam and sorting and indexing the bam files) are done with tools not designed to be used in windows, hence this is performed in Linux.\n",

    "\n",
    "An overview of the different steps including some software that can handle this is shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Checking the raw FASTA or FASTQ data can be done using the\n",
    "    ([**FASTQC**](<https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/>)) software (Windows, Linux, Mac. Requires Java).\n",
    "    This gives a quality report (see accompanying tutorial) for the sequence reads and can be run non-interactively using the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Based on the quality report, the data needs to be trimmed to remove any unwanted sequences.\n",
    "    This can be done with for example ([**FASTX**](<http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html>)) (Linux, Mac) or ([**Trimmomatic**](<http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic>)) (Windows,requires Java).\n",
    "    An easy graphical user interface that combines the FASTQC and Trimmomatic is ([**123FASTQ**](<https://sourceforge.net/projects/project-123ngs/>)).\n",
    "    Also **BBDuk** can be used for trimming (which belongs to BBMap).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The trimmed sequence reads need to be aligned using a reference\n",
    "    sequence, for example the *S. Cerevisiae* [S288C Ref64-2-1 reference sequence](<https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/>) or the [W303 reference sequence](<http://sgd-archive.yeastgenome.org/sequence/strains/W303/W303_SGD_2015_JRIU00000000/>) from SGD.\n",
    "    Aligning can be done, for example, using ([**SnapGene**](<https://www.snapgene.com/>)) (Windows, Linux, Mac. This does not\n",
    "    import large files and is therefore not suitable for whole genome\n",
    "    sequencing), ([**BBMap**](<https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/>)) (Linux, Mac, Windows (seems to give problems when installing on windows machines), might be possible to integrate it in Python, ([**BWA**](<http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/>)) (Linux, Mac), ([**Bowtie2**](<http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml>)) (Linux, Mac) or ([**ClustalOmega**](<http://www.clustal.org/omega/>)) (Windows, Linux, Mac).\n",
    "    This step might require defining scores for matches, mismatches, gaps and insertions of nucleotides.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After aligning, the data needs to be converted to SAM and BAM formats for easier processing hereafter.\n",
    "    This requires ([**SAMtools**](<http://www.htslib.org/>)) (Linux, Mac) or ([**GATK**](<https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us>)) (Linux, Mac).\n",
    "    Conversion from SAM to BAM can also be done in Matlab if preferred using the ‘BioMap’ function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using the BAM file with the aligned sequence reads, the transposon insertion sites can be determined using the [**Matlab** script given by Benoit Kornmann Lab](<https://sites.google.com/site/satayusers/>) (including the name.mat and yeastGFF.mat files).\n",
    "    The results from this step are three files (a .txt file, a .bed file and a .wig file) that can be used for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If more processing is required, ([**Picard**](<https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/>)) (Linux, Mac) might be useful, as well as ([**GATK**](<https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us>)) (Linux, Mac).\n",

    "If using interactively, open the ‘run\\_fastqc.bat’ file in the FASTQC folder and load a file to be checked. Alternatively using the 123FASTQ (version 1.1) program, open this and use the ‘Quality Check’ menu on the right.\n",
    "The advantage of using 123FASTQ is that it can also do trimming (using Trimmomatic).\n",
    "\n",
    "If using the command line for checking a single file use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`fastqc --outdir ${path_fastqc_out} ${pathdata}/${filename}`**\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that the output directory should already exist, as the program does not create directories).\n",
    "In the output directory, a .html file and a (zipped) folder is created, both with the same name as the input file.\n",
    "The .html file can be used to quickly see the graphs using a browser.\n",
    "Also, a zipped folder is created where the raw data of the quality check is stored.\n",
    "For explanation about the different graphs, see the fastqc\\_manual pdf or [<https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/>] (or the paper ‘Preprocessing and Quality Control for Whole-Genome’ from Wright et.al. or the ‘Assessing Read Quality’ workshop from the Datacarpentry Genomics workshop).\n",

    "    Each contaminant is presented on a different line the text file and should have the form name 'tab' sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- --adapters Similar as the contaminants command, but specifically for adapter sequences.\n",
    "    Also here a text file should be created before running and this file should have the same layout as the contaminants file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- --min_length where a minimal sequence length can be set, so that the statistics can be better compared between different reads of different length (which for example might occur after trimming).\n",
    "\n",
    "- --threads Preferably leave this unchanged, especially when an error is shown that there ‘could not reserve enough space for object heap’ after setting this command.\n",

    "The output of the FASTQC program is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per base sequence quality**: Box and whisker plot for the quality of a basepair position in all reads.\n",
    "The quality should be above approximately 30 for most reads, but the quality typically drops near the end of the sequences.\n",
    "If the ends of the reads are really bad, consider trimming those in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per tile sequence quality**: (Shows only when Illumina Library which retains there sequence identifier).\n",
    "Shows a heat map of the quality per tile of the sequence machines.\n",
    "Blueish colours indicate that the quality score is about or better than average and reddish colours indicates scores worse than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per sequence quality score**: Shows an accumulative distribution to indicate which mean quality score per sequence occurs most often.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per base sequence content**: Shows the percentage of nucleotide appearance in all sequences.\n",
    "Assuming a perfectly random distribution for all four nucleotides, each nucleotide should be present about 25% over the entire sequence. In the beginning this might be a bit off due to for example adapters present in the sequences.\n",
    "If this is present, it might difficult/impossible to cut these during the trimming part, but it should typically not seriously affect further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per sequence GC content**: Indicates the distribution of the G-C nucleotides appearances in the genome.\n",
    "The ideal distribution that is expected based on the data is shown as a blue curve.\n",
    "The red curve should, ideally follow the blue curve.\n",
    "If the red curve is more or less a normal distribution, but shifted from the blue curve, is might indicate a systematic bias which might be caused by an inaccurate estimation of the GC content in the blue curve.\n",
    "This does not necessarily indicate bad data.\n",
    "When the red curve is not normal or show irregularities (peaks or flat parts), this might indicate contaminants in the sample or overrepresented sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per base N content**: Counts the number of N appearances in the data for each basepair position of all reads.\n",
    "Every time a nucleotide cannot be accurately determine during sequencing, it is flagged with a N (No hit) in the sequence instead of one of the nucleotides.\n",
    "Ideally this should never occur in the data and this graph should be a flat line at zero over the entire length.\n",
    "Although at the end of the sequences it might occur few times, but it should not occur more than a few percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence length distribution**: Shows the length of all sequences.\n",
    "    Ideally all reads should have the same length, but this might change, for example, after trimming.\n",

    "- **Sequence duplication level**: Indicates how often some sequences appear the data.\n",
    "Ideally, all reads occur only few times and a high peak is expected near 1.\n",
    "If peaks are observed at higher numbers, this might indicate enrichment bias during the sequencing preparation (e.g. over amplification during PCR).\n",
    "Only the first 100000 sequences are considered and when the length of the reads is over 75bp, the reads are cut down to pieces of 50bp.\n",
    "Some duplication might not be bad and therefore a warning or error here does not need to concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overrepresented sequences**: List of sequences that appear in more 0.1% of the total (this is only considered for the first 100000 sequences and reads over 75bp are truncated to 50bp pieces).\n",
    "The program gives a warning (when sequences are found to be present between 0.1% and 1% of the total amount of sequences) or an error (when there are sequences occurring more 1% of all sequences), but this does not always mean that the data is bad and might be ignored.\n",
    "For Illumina sequencing for satay experiments, the sequences often start with either 'CATG' or 'GATC' which are the recognition sites for NlaIII and DpnII respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adapter content**: Shows an accumulative percentage plot of repeated sequences with a positional bias appearing in the data.\n",
    "So if many reads have the same sequence at (or near) the same location, then this might trigger a warning in this section.\n",
    "Ideally this is a flat line at zero (meaning that there are no repeated sequences present in the data).\n",
    "If this is not a flat line at zero, it might be necessary to cut the reported sequences during the trimming step.\n",
    "If this section gives a warning, a list is shown with all the repeated sequences including some statistics.\n",
    "It can be useful to delete these sequences in the trimming step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kmer content**: indicates sequences with a position bias that are ofen repeated.\n",
    "If a specific sequence occurs at the same location (i.e. basepair number) in many reads, then this module will show which sequence at which location turns up frequently.\n",
    "Note that in later editions (0.11.6 and up) this module is by default turned off.\n",
    "If you want to turn this module on again, go to the Configuration folder in the Fastqc folder and edit the limits.txt file in the line where it says 'kmer  ignore  1' and change the 1 in a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Trimming of the sequencing reads\n",
    "\n",
    "Next is the trimming of the sequencing reads to cut out, for example, repeated (adapter) sequences and low quality reads.\n",
    "There are two software tools adviced, Trimmomatic and BBDuk.\n",
    "Trimmomatic is relative simple to use and can be used interactively together with FASTQC.\n",
    "However, the options can be limiting if you want more control over the trimming protocol.\n",
    "An alternative is BBDuk, which is part of the BBMap software package.\n",
    "This allows for more options, but can therefore also be more confusing to use initially.\n",
    "Both software packages are explained below, but only one needs to be used.\n",
    "Currently, it is advised to use BBDuk (see section 2b).\n",

    "`java -jar ${path_trimm_software}'trimmomatic-0.39.jar'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running Trimmomatic, a .fasta file needs to be created that allows clipping unwanted sequences in the reads.\n",
    "For example, the 'overrepresented sequences' as found by Fastqc can be clipped by adding the sequences to the .fasta file.\n",
    "Easiest is to copy an existing .fasta file that comes with Trimmomatic and adding extra sequences that needs to be clipped.\n",
    "For MiSeq sequencing, it is advised to use the TruSeq3 adapter file that needs to be copied to the data folder (see below for detailed explanation).\n",

    "If there is a match, the entire alignment between the read and the complete adapter sequence is given a score.\n",
    "A perfect match gets a score of 0.6.\n",
    "Each mismatching base reduces the score by Q/10.\n",
    "When the score exceeds a threshold, the adapter is clipped from the read. The first number in the parameter gives the maximal number of mismatches allowed in the seeds (typically 2).\n",
    "The second value is the minimal score before the adapter is clipped (typically between 7 (requires $\\frac{7}{0.6}=12$ perfect matches) and 15 (requires $\\frac{15}{0.6}=25$ perfect matches)).\n",
    "High values for short reads (so many perfect matches are needed) allows for clipping adapters, but not for adapter contaminations.\n",

    "In the case of Trimmomatic it is advised to use the TruSeq3 adapter file when using MiSeq sequencing.\n",
    "To copy the .fasta file to the data folder (see below for detailed explanation) use the following command:\n",

    " `cp ${path_trimm_software}'adapters/''TruSeq3-SE.fa' ${pathdata}`\n",

    "\n",
    "The adapters.fa file from the BBDuk package includes many different adapter sequences, so it might be good to remove everything that is not relevant.\n",
    "One option can be to create a custom fasta file where all the sequences are placed that need to be trimmed and save this file in the bbmap/resources folder.\n",
    "To do this, in order to let everything work properly it is best to alter one of the existing .fa files.\n",
    "First copy that file as a backup using a different name (e.g. in the `#{path_bbduk_software}/resources` directory type the command `cp adapters.fa adapters_original_backup.fa`).\n",
    "Then, alter the adapters.fa file with any sequences you want to get trimmed.\n",
    "Note to not put empty lines in the text file, otherwise BBDuk might yield an error about not finding the adapters.fa file.\n",

    "Typically it is useful to clip overrepresented sequences that were found by FASTQC and sequences that start with 'CATG' or 'GATC' which are the recognition sites for NlaIII and DpnII respectively.\n",
    "Note that the trimming is performed in the order in which the steps are given as input.\n",
    "Typically the adapter clipping is performed as one of the first steps and removing short sequences as one of the final steps.\n",

    "BBDuk uses a kmers algorithm, which basically means it divides the reads in pieces of length k.\n",
    "(For example, the sequence 'abcd' has the following 2mers: ab,bc,cd).\n",
    "For each of these pieces the software checks if it contains any sequences that are present in the adapter file.\n",
    "The kmers process divides both the reads and the adapters in pieces of length k and it then looks for an exact match.\n",
    "If an exact match is found between a read and an adapter, then that read is trimmed.\n",
    "If the length k is chosen to be bigger than the length of the smallest adapter, then there will never be an exact match between any of the reads and the adapter sequence and the adapter will therefore never be trimmed.\n",
    "However, when the length k is too small the trimming might be too specific and it might trim too many reads.\n",
    "Typically, the length k is chosen about the size of the smallest adapter sequence or slighty smaller.\n",
    "For more details, see [this webpage](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical command for BBDuk looks like this:\n",

    "Next an overview is given with some of the most useful options.\n",
    "For a full overview use call `bbduk.sh` in the bash without any options.\n",

    "Depending on the maximum memory of your computer, setting this to `1g` should typically not result in such an error.\n",
    "2. `in` and `out`. Input and Output files.\n",
    "For paired-end sequencing, use also the commands `in2` and `out2`.\n",
    "The input accepts zipped files, but make sure the files have the right extension (e.g. file.fastq.gz).\n",
    "Use `outm` (and `outm2` when using paired-end reads) to also save all reads that failed to pass the trimming.\n",
    "Note that defining an absolute path for the path-out command does not work properly.\n",
    "Best is to simply put a filename for the file containing the trimmed reads which is then stored in the same directory as the input file and then move this trimmed reads file to any other location using:\n",
    "`mv ${pathdata}${filename::-6}_trimmed.fastq ${path_trimm_out}`\n",
    "3. `qin`. Set the quality format.\n",
    "33 for phred 33 or 64 for phred 64 or auto for autodetect (default is auto).\n",
    "4. `ref`. This command points to a .fasta file containg the adapters.\n",
    "This should be stored in the location where the other files are stored for the BBDuk software (`${path_bbduk_software}/resources`)\n",
    "Next are a few commands relating to the kmers algorithm.\n",
    "5. `ktrim`. This can be set to either don't trim (`f`, default), right trimming (`r`), left trimming (`l`).\n",
    "Basically, this means what needs to be trimmed when an adapter is found, where right trimming is towards the 5'-end and left trimming is towards the 3'-end.\n",
    "For example, when setting this option to `ktrim=r`, then when a sequence is found that matches an adapter sequence, all the basepairs on the right of this matched sequence will be deleted including the matched sequence itself.\n",
    "When deleting the whole reads, set `ktrim=rl`.\n",
    "6. `kmask`. Instead of trimming a read when a sequence matches an adapter sequence, this sets the matching sequence to another symbol (e.g. `kmask=N`).\n",
    "7. `k`. This defines the number of kmers to be used. This should be not be longer than the smallest adapter sequences and should also not be too short as there might too much trimmed. Typically values around 20 works fine (default=27).\n",
    "8. `mink`. When the lenght of a read is not a perfect multiple of the value of `k`, then at the end of the read there is a sequence left that is smaller than length k. Setting `mink` allows the software to use smaller kmers as well near the end of the reads.\n",
    "The sequence at the end of a read are matched with adapter sequences using kmers with length between mink and k.\n",
    "9. `minkmerhits`. Determines how many kmers in the read must match the adapter sequence.\n",
    "Default is 1, but this can be increased when for example using short kmers to decrease the chance that wrong sequences are trimmed that happen to have a single matching kmer with an adapter.\n",
    "10. `minkmerfraction`. A kmer in this read is considered a match with an adapter when at least a fraction of the read matches the adapter kmer.\n",
    "11. `mincovfraction`. At least a fraction of the read needs to match adapter kmer sequences in order to be regarded a match.\n",
    "Use either `minkmerhits`, `minkmerfraction` or `mincovfraction`, but setting multiple results in that only one of them will be used during the processing.\n",
    "12. `hdist`. This is the Hamming distance, which is defined as the minimum number of substitutions needed to convert one string in another string.\n",
    "Basically this indicates how many errors are allowed between a read and and an adapter sequence to still count as an exact match.\n",
    "Typically does not need to be set any higher than 1, unless the reads are of very low quality.\n",
    "Note that high values of hdist also requires much more memory in the computer.\n",
    "13. `restrictleft` and `restrictright`. Only look for kmers left or right number bases.\n",
    "14. `tpe` and `tbo`: This is only relevant for paired-end reads.\n",
    "`tpe` cuts both the forward and the reverse read to the same length and `tbo` trims the reads if they match any adapter sequence while considering the overlap between two paired reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far all the options were regarding the adapter trimming (more options are available as well, check out the [user guide](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/)).\n",
    "These options go before any other options, for example the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "15. `qtrim`. This an option for quality trimming which indicates whether the reads should be trimmed on the right (`r`), the left (`l`), both (`fl`), neither (`f`) or that a slidingwindow needs to be used (`w`).\n",
    "The threshold for the trimming quality is set by `trimq`.\n",
    "16. `trimq`. This sets the minimum quality that is still allowed using phred scores (e.g. Q=14 corresponds with $P_{error} = 0.04$).\n",
    "17. `minlength`. This sets the minimum length that the reads need to have after all previous trimming steps.\n",
    "Reads short than the value given here are discarded completely.\n",
    "18. `mlf`. Alternatively to the `minlen` option, the Minimum Length Fraction can be used which determines the fraction of the length of the read before and after trimming and if this drops below a certain value (e.g 50%, so `mlf=50`), then this read is trimmed.\n",
    "19. `maq`. Discard reads that have an average quality below the specified Q-value.\n",
    "This can be useful after quality trimming to discard reads where the really poor quality basepairs are trimmed, but the rest of the basepairs are of poor quality as well.\n",
    "20. `ftl` and `ftr` (`forcetrimleft` and `forcetrimright`). This cuts a specified amount of basepairs at the beginning (`ftl`) or the last specified amount of basepairs (`ftr`).\n",
    "Note that this is zero based, for example `ftl=10` trims basepairs 0-9.\n",
    "21. `ftm`. This force Trim Modulo option can sometimes be useful when an extra, unwanted and typically very poor quality, basepair is added at the end of a read.\n",
    "So when reads are expected to be all 75bp long, this will discard the last basepair in 76bp reads.\n",
    "When such extra basepairs are present, it will be noted in FastQC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to check the quality of the trimmed sequence using the command:\n",

    "BWA uses a FM-index, which uses the Burrows Wheeler Transform (BWT), to exactly align all the reads to the reference genome at the same time.\n",
    "Each alignment is given a score, based on the number of matches, mismatches and potential gaps and insertions.\n",
    "The highest possible score is 60, meaning that the read aligns perfectly to the reference sequence (this score is saved in the SAM file as MAPQ).\n",
    "Besides the required 11 fields in the SAM file, BWA gives some optional fields to indicate various aspects of the mapping, for example the alignment score (for a complete overview and explanation, see the [documentation](<http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml>)).\n",
    "The generated SAM file also include headers where the names of all chromosomes are shown (lines starting with SQ).\n",
    "These names are used to indicate where each read is mapped to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before use, the reference sequence should be indexed so that the program knows where to find potential alignment sites.\n",

    "\n",
    "`bwa index /path/to/reference/sequence/file.fasta`\n",
