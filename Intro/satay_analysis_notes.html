<p>This file discusses the general outline of the experiments and interpretation of experiments using SAturated Transposon Analysis in Yeast (SATAY).
The introduction explains the purpose of the experiments and what kind of results we expect and how to interpret these results.
The Methods and File types section explains the different kind of files used during processing and analysis and how to read and use them.
It also explains some custom made software for analyzing the data.

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>About 20% of the genes in wild type <em>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae</em> are essential, meaning that they cannot be deleted without crippling the cell to such an extent that it either cannot survive (lethality) or multiply
(sterility).
(Non)-essentiality of genes is not constant over different genetic backgrounds, but genes can gain or lose essentiality when other genes are mutated.
Moreover, it is expected that the interactions between genes changes in mutants (changes in the interaction map).
This raises a number of questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>If there exists a relation between genes which gain or lose essentiality after mutations and the changes in the interaction map?</em></p></li>
<li><p>If a gene x gains or loses essentiality after a mutation in gene y, does the essentiality of gene y also changes if a mutation in gene x is provoked?</p></li>
<li><p>After a mutation that reduces the fitness of a population of cells, the population is sometimes able to increase its fitness by mutating other genes (e.g. dBem1 eventually result in mutations in Bem3).
Can these mutations, that are initiated by cells themselves, be predicted based on the interaction maps (i.e. predict survival of the fittest)?</p></li>
<li><p>If a gene x is suppressed, it will possibly change the essentiality of another gene.
It is expected that most changes in essentiality will occur in the same subnetwork of the mutated gene.
If a gene y is suppressed that is part of the same network as gene x, does this invoke similar changes in this subnetwork?
In other words, are there common changes in the subnetwork when a random change is made within this subnetwork?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there relations between the changes in the interaction network after a mutation and the Genetic Ontology (GO-)terms of changed genes?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To check the essentiality of genes, SATAY (SAturated Transposon Analysis in Yeast) experiments will be performed on different genetic backgrounds [Michel et.al., 2017] [Segal et.al., 2018].
This uses transposons to inhibit genes and it allows to compare the effects of this inhibition on the fitness of the cells (see for example the <a class="reference external" href="https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/tnseq/tutorial.html">galaxyproject website</a> which explains it in the context of bacteria, but the same principles hold for yeast cells).
Transposons are small pieces of DNA that can integrate in a random location in the genome.
When the insertion happens at the location of a gene, this gene will be inhibited (i.e. it can still be transcribed, but typically it cannot be translated into a functional protein).</p>
<p>After a transposon is randomly inserted in the DNA, the growth of the cell is checked.
If the cell cannot produce offspring, the transposon has likely been inserted in an essential gene or genomic region.
This is done for many cells at the same time.</p>
<p>All the cells are let to grow after insertion and the cells that have a transposon inserted in an essential part of their DNA (therefore having a low fitness) will, after some time, be outcompeted by the cells with an insertion in a non-essential part of the DNA (cells with a relatively high fitness).
By means of sequencing, the location of the transposon insertion can be checked and related to a specific gene.
Since the cells that have an essential part of the genome blocked do not occur in the population, those cells are not sequenced and hence the location of the transposon in these cells are missing in the sequencing results.
Thus, when the sequencing results of all the cells are aligned to a reference genome, some genomic locations are missing in the sequencing results.
These missing locations corresponds to potentially essential genomic regions.
The genome of all cells (called the library) is saturated when all possible insertion sites have at least one insertion of a transposon.
In that case all regions of the DNA are checked for their essentiality.</p>
<div class="section" id="essentiality">
<h2>Essentiality<a class="headerlink" href="#essentiality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Essentiality of genes are defined as its deletion is determental to cell in the form that either the cell cannot grow anymore and dies, or the cell cannot give rise to offspring.
Essentiality can be grouped in two categories, namely type I and type II [Chen et.al. 2016].
Type I essential genes are genes, when inhibited, show a loss-of-function that can only be rescued (or masked) when the lost function is recovered by a gain-of-function mechanism.
Typically these genes are important for some indispensable core function in the cell (e.g. Cdc42 in <em>S. Cerevisiae</em> that is type I essential for cell polarity).
Type II essential genes are the ones that look essential upon inhibition, but the effects of its inhibition can be rescued or masked by the deletion of (an)other gene(s).
These genes are therefore not actually essential, but when inhibiting the genes some toxic side effects are provoked that are deleterious for the cells.</p>
<p>The idea is that the essentiality of genes (both type I and type II), may change between different genetic backgrounds.
For changes in essentiality four cases are considered:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>A gene is <strong>essential</strong> in WT and remains <strong>essential</strong> in the
mutant.</p></li>
<li><p>A gene is <strong>non-essential</strong> in WT and remains <strong>non-essential</strong> in
the mutant.</p></li>
<li><p>A gene is <strong>essential</strong> in WT and becomes <strong>non-essential</strong> in the
mutant.</p></li>
<li><p>A gene is <strong>non-essential</strong> in WT and becomes <strong>essential</strong> in the
mutant.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An example is given in the figure below, where an interaction map is
shown for WT cells and a possible interaction map for a mutant where
both the essentiality and the interactions are changed.</p>
<!-- ![Example interaction network for a WT cell and a mutant with essential and non-essential genes.](./media/example_interaction_network.png) -->
<p>Situation 1 and 3 are expected to be the trickiest since those ones are difficult to validate.
To check the synthetic lethality in cells, a double mutation needs to be made where one mutation makes the genetic background and the second mutation should confirm whether the second mutated gene is actually essential or not.
This is typically made by sporulating the two mutants, but deleting a gene that is already essential in wild type prevents the cell from growing or dividing and can therefore not be sporulated with the mutant to create the double deletion.
Therefore, these double mutants are hard or impossible to make.</p>
<p>Another point to be aware of is that some genes might be essential in specific growth conditions (see also the subsection).
For example, cells that are grown in an environment that is rich of a specific nutrient, the gene(s) that are requried for the digestion of this nutrient might be essential in this condition.
The SATAY experiments will therefore show that these genes are intolerant for transposon insertions.
However, when the cells are grown in another growth condition where mainly other nutrients are present, the same genes might now not be essential and therefore also be more tolerent to transposon insertions in that region.
It is suggested to compare the results of experiments with cells from the same genetic background grown in different conditions with each other to rule out conditions specific results.</p>
<p>For wild-type (and some mutated) yeast, the interaction network is already made based on previous research <code class="xref any docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thecellmap.org</span></code>.
We want to check the essentiality of all genes in different mutants and compare this with both wild type cells and with each other.
The goal is to make an overview of the changes in the essentiality of the genes and the interaction network between the proteins.
With this we aim to eventually be able to predict the synthetic lethality of multiple mutations based on the interaction maps of the individual mutations.
Currently the idea is to use machine learning that uses the results from the transposon sequencing experiments, the interaction map of genes and possibly GO-terms (see for current progress <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/leilaicruz/machine-learning-for-yeast">the github page for machine learning</a>.)</p>

<div class="section" id="interpreting-transposon-counts-reads">
<h2>Interpreting Transposon Counts &amp; Reads<a class="headerlink" href="#interpreting-transposon-counts-reads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once cells have a transposon inserted somewhere in the DNA, the cells are let to grow so they can potentially generate a few new generations.
A cell with a tranposon inserted in an essential part of its DNA grows very slowly or might not grow at all (due to its decreased fitness).
Since the sequencing starts only at the location of a transposon insertion (see experimental methods section), it can be concluded that roughly each read from the sequencing corresponds with a transposon insertion (roughly mainly because transposon inserted in essential genes can generate no reads).
Cells with a transposon inserted in an essential genomic region, will not have divided and therefore will not have a contribution to the sequencing reads.
When the reads are aligned to a reference sequence and the number of reads are mapped against the genome, empty regions indicate possible essential genes.
Negative selection can thus be found by looking for empty regions in the reads mapping.
When a transposon is inserted in a non-essential genomic region, these cells can still divide and give rise to offspring and after sequencing the non-essential regions will be represented by relatively many reads.</p>
<p>During processing the genes can be analyzed using the number of transposon insertions per gene (or region) or the number of reads per gene.
Reads per gene, instead of transposons per gene, might be a good measure for positive selection since it is more sensitive (bigger difference in number of reads between essential and non-essential genes), but also tends to be nosier.
Transposons per gene is less noisy, but is also less sensitive since the number of transposons inserted in a gene does not change in subsequent generations of a particular cell.
Therefore it is hard to tell the fitness of cells when a transposon is inserted a non-essential region solely based on the number of transposon insertions.</p>
<p>Ideally only the transposons inserted in non-essential genomic regions will have reads (since only these cells can create a colony before sequencing), creating a clear difference between the essential and non-essential genes.
However, sometimes non-essential genes also have few or no transposon insertion sites.
According to <a class="reference external" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/23570">Michel et.al.</a> this can have 3 main reasons.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>During alignment of the reads, the reads that represent repeated DNA sequences are discarded, since there is no unique way of fitting
them in the completed sequence.
(Although the DNA sequence is repeated, the number of transposon counts can differ between the repeated regions).
Transposons within such repeated sequences are therefore discarded and the corresponding reads not count.
If this happens at a non-essential gene, it appears that it has no transposons, but this is thus merely an alignment related error in the analysis process.</p></li>
<li><p>Long stretches of DNA that are without stop codons, called Open Reading Frames (ORF), typically code for proteins.
Some dubious ORF might overlap with essential proteins, so although these ORF themselves are not essential, the overlapping part is and therefore they do not show any transposons.</p></li>
<li><p>Some genes are essential only in specific conditions.
For example, genes that are involved in galactose metabolism are typically not essential, as inhibition of these genes block the cell’s ability to digest galactose, but it can still survive on other nutrition’s.
In lab conditions however, the cells are typically grown in galactose rich media, and inhibiting the genes for galactose metabolism cause starvation of the cells.</p></li>
<li><p>A gene might not be essential, but its deletion might cripple the cell so that the growth rate decreases significantly.
When the cells are grown, the more healthy cells grow much faster and, after some time, occur more frequently in the population than these crippled cells and therefore these cells might not generate many reads or no reads at all.
In the processing, it might therefore look as if these genes are essential, but in fact they are not.
The cells just grow very slowly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The other way around might also occcur, where essential genes are partly tolerant to transposons.
This is shown by Michel et.al. to be caused that some regions (that code for specific subdomains of the proteins) of the essential genes are dispensable.
The transposons in these essential genes are clearly located at a specific region in the gene, the one that codes for a non-essential subdomain.
However, this is not always possible, as in some cases deletion of non-essential subdomains of essential genes create unstable, unexpressed or toxin proteins.
The difference in essentiality between subdomains in a single protein only happens in essential genes, not in non-essential genes.
Michel et.al. devised an algorithm to estimate the likelihood <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> of a gene having an essential subdomain:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[L = \frac{\text{d }N_{\text{cds}}}{l_{\text{cds}}}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> is the longest interval (in terms of base pairs) between 5 neighboring transposons in a Coding DNA Sequence (cds) (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\geq 300\)</span> bp), <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{cds}\)</span> is the total number transposons mapping in the cds (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\geq 20\)</span>) transposons) and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l_{cds}\)</span> is the total length of the CDS.
Additionally, it must hold that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.1 l_{cds} \leq d \leq 0.9 l_{cds}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is expected that only essential genes cary essential subdomains, and indeed what was found by Michel et.al. that the genes with the highest likelihood were mostly also genes previously annotated as essential by other studies.</p>
<p>Because of the reasons mentioned before, not a simple binary conclusion can be made solely based on the amount of transposon insertions or the number of reads.
Instead, a gene with little reads <em>might</em> be essential, but to be sure the results from other experiments need to be implemented as well, for example where the cells were grown in a different growth conditions.
Therefore, SATAY analysis only says something about the relative fitness of cells where a specific gene is inhibited in the current growth conditions.</p>

<div class="section" id="methods-and-file-types">
<h1>Methods and File types<a class="headerlink" href="#methods-and-file-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Many essential genes in wild type cells are already known and published.
The results from our SATAY experiments we can verify using the known essential genes and check how well they fit with the number of reads in each gene.
Also, we can use a similar approach as was performed by the Kornmann lab [Michel et.al. 2017] using wild type cells (see also <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/satayusers/">the SATAY users website</a>).
Comparison of our results with those obtained by the Kornmann lab might confirm the quality of our experimental and analysis methods.
Once our experimental method is verified, we want to compare the differences in essentiality of genes in wild type with different mutants (e.g. dBem1, dBem2, dBem3 and dNrp1).
For fast processing of many experimental results, a tool needs to be developed that automatically converts the raw sequencing data to a list of the number of transposons and reads for each gene, and potentially list some of their properties (e.g. essentiality, GO-terms, interactions etc.).</p>
<div class="section" id="experimental-method-summary">
<h2>Experimental method summary<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-method-summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The process of SATAY starts with inserting a plasmid in the cells that contains a transposase (TPase) and the transposon (MiniDs) flanked on both sides by adenine (ADE).
The transposon has a specific, known, sequence that codes for the transposase that cuts the transposon from the plasmid (or DNA) to (another part of) the DNA.</p>
<!-- ![Simplified example for the transposon insertion plasmid.](./media/Plasmid_transposon.png) -->
<p>(See next figure for the following section).
The MiniDs transposon is cut loose from the plasmid and randomly inserted in the DNA of the host cell.
If the transposon is inserted in a gene, the gene can still be transcribed by the ribosomes, but typically cannot be (properly)
translated in a functional protein.
The genomic DNA (with the transposon) is cut in pieces for sequencing using enzymes, for example DpnII.
This cuts the DNA in many small pieces (e.g. each 75bp long) and it always cuts the transposon in two parts (i.e. digestion of the DNA).
Each of the two halves of the cut transposon, together with the part of the gene where the transposon is inserted in, is ligated meaning that it is folded in a circle.
A part of the circle is then the half transposon and the rest of the circle is a part of the gene where the transposon is inserted in.
Using PCR and primers, this can then be unfolded by cutting the circle at the halved transposon.
The part of the gene is then between the transposon quarters.
Since the sequence of the transposon is known, the part of the gene can be extracted.
This is repeated for the other half of the transposon that includes the other part of the gene.
When both parts of the gene are known, the sequence from the original gene can be determined.</p>
<!-- ![Schematic overview of transposon insertion experiments.](./media/satay_experiment_overview.png) -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="sequence-alignment">
<h2>Sequence alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#sequence-alignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To get the order of nucleotides in a genome, shotgun sequencing is used where the genome is cut is small pieces called reads (typically tens to a few hundred basepairs long).
The reads have overlapping regions that can be used to identify their location with respect to a reference genome and other reads (i.e. mapping of the reads).
Mapping of the reads result in contigs, which are multiple mapped reads that form continuous assembled parts of the genome (contigs can be the entire target genome itself).
All contigs should be assembled to form (a large part of) the target genome.</p>
<p>The sequence assembly problem can be described as: <em>Given a set of sequences, find the minimal length string containing all members of the set as substrings</em>.</p>
<p>The reads from the sequencing can be single-end or paired-end, which indicates how the sequencing is performed.
In paired-end sequencing, the reads are sequenced from both directions, making the assembly easier and more reliable, but results in twice as many reads as single-end reads.
The reason of the more reliable results has to do with ambiguous reads that might occur in the single-end sequencing.
Here, a read can be assigned to two different locations on the reference genome (and have the same alignment score).
In these cases, it cannot be determined where the read should actually be aligned (hence its position is ambiguous).
In paired-end sequencing, each DNA fragment has primers on both ends, meaning that the sequencing can start in both the 5’-3’ direction and in the 3’-5’ direction.
Each DNA fragment therefore has two reads both which have a specified length that is shorter than the entire DNA fragment.
This results that a DNA fragment is read on both ends, but the central part will still be unknown (as it is not covered by these two particular reads, but it will be covered by other reads).
Since you know that the two reads belong close together, the alignment of one read can be checked by the alignment of the second read (or paired mate) somewhere in close vicinity on the reference sequence.
This is usually enough for the reads to become unambiguous.</p>
<p>The resulting data from the sequencing is stored in a FASTQ file where all individual reads are stored including a quality score of the sequencing.
The reads are in random order and therefore the first step in the processing is aligning of the reads in the FASTQ files with a reference genome.</p>
<p>Note that the quality of the reads typically decreases near the 3’-end of the reads due to the chemistry processes required for sequencing (this depends on the kind of method used).
For Illumina sequencing, the main reasons are signal decay and dephasing, both causing a relative increase in the background noise.
Dephasing occurs when a DNA fragment is not de-blocked properly.
A DNA fragment is copied many times and all copies incorporate a fluorescent nucleotide that can be imaged to identify the nucleotide.
If there are 1000 copies of the DNA fragment, there are 1000 fluorescent nucleotides that, ideally, are all the same to create a high quality signal.
After imaging, the DNA fragment is de-blocked to allow a new fluorescent nucleotide to bind.
This deblocking might not work for all copies of the DNA fragment.
For example, 100 copies might not be deblocked properly, so for the next nucleotide only 900 copies agree for the next incorporated nucleotide.
For the third round, the 100 copies that were not deblocked properly in the second round, might now be deblocked as well, but now they are lagging behind one nucleotide, meaning that in the coming rounds they have consistently the wrong nucleotide.
As the reads increases in length, more rounds are needed and therefore the chances of dephasing increases causing a decrease in the quality of the reads.
This gives noise in the signal of the new nucleotide and therefore the quality of the signal decreases.
For example, take the next 6bp sequence that is copied 5 times:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GATGTC</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GATGTC</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G</span> <span class="pre">ATGT</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GAT</span> <span class="pre">GT</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G</span> <span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">G</span></code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two reads are deblocked properly and they give all the right nucleotides.
But the third and fourth have one round that is not deblocked properly (indicated by the empty region between the nucleotides), hence the nucleotide is always lagging one bp after the failed deblocking.
The fifth copy has two failed deblocking situations, hence is lagging two bp.
The first nucleotide is a G for all 5 copies, therefore the quality of this nucleotide is perfect.
But, by the end of the read, only two out of five copies have the correct bp (i.e. a C), therefore the quality is poor for this nucleotide.
(It can either be a C or a T with equal likelyhood or potentially a G, so determining which nucleotide is correct is ambiguous without knowing which reads are lagging, which you don’t know).

<h2>FASTQ files and FASTA files<a class="headerlink" href="#fastq-files-and-fasta-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The output of sequencing is typically a FASTQ file.
This file contains the sequences of all reads (typically 75 to 100 bp long).
Each read is represented by four lines:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Starts with ‘&#64;’ followed by a sequences identifier and can include
some descriptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Raw sequence letters representing the nucleotides.</p></li>
<li><p>Starts with ‘+’ for separating the second and third line.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality score of the sequence represented by ASCII symbols running
from ‘!’ (lowest score) to ‘~’ (highest score)
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.asciitable.com/">http://www.asciitable.com/</a>]. This is called ASCII-base 33 since
‘!’ has decimal ASCII number 33 and is defined as Q-score 0. This
typically runs towards ASCII symbol ‘J’ (number 74, Q-score 41). The
error probability can be calculated based on the Q-score using
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{error} = 10^{-\frac{Q}{10}}\)</span>. This means that ‘!’ has
an error of (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{error} = 100\%\)</span>) and ‘J’ an error of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{error} = 0.008\%\)</span>). Typically a Q-score higher than Q=20

</ol>
<p>A FASTQ file can be used as an input for sequence alignment using a reference genome.
The result of sequence alignment is a SAM file.</p>
<p>Besides FASTQ files, FASTA files are also used for alignment.
These are similar to FASTQ files, but do not include the quality string and therefore FASTA files can be created from FASTQ files by removing line 3 and 4 from each read.
Depending on the sequencing method, FASTA files may be directly given.</p>

<div class="section" id="sam-and-bam-files">
<h2>SAM and BAM files<a class="headerlink" href="#sam-and-bam-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The FASTQ (or FASTA) files contain all the reads in a random order.
To determine where each belong relative to a reference sequence, the reads
need to be aligned.
After alignment of the reads, the results are typically represented in a Sequencing Alignment Mapping (SAM) file.
For processing purposes this is typically translated to a Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file.
This is a compressed, binary version of the SAM file.</p>
<p>The SAM files contain all the short reads from the FASTQ file together with information where and how well the read mapped to a reference
sequence.
The reads are represented by a header and a body.
The header consists of four fields (note that the headers can be different depending which program made the alignment, see for example <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cpwardell.com/2015/02/24/understanding-bam-files-part-1/">cpwardell.com</a>):</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>&#64;HD lines: version number of SAM specification and how the file is
sorted (e.g. sorting by genomic coordinates).</p></li>
<li><p>&#64;SQ: Which reference sequence has been used to align the sequence.
There will be one line for every chromosome (contig). It also tells
the sequence name (SN) and length (LN).</p></li>
<li><p>&#64;RG: Read group line with the tags specifying the origins of the
input data.</p></li>
<li><p>&#64;PG: Which programs and commands were used to create the SAM file.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The body of the SAM file contains the aligned data.
Every row contains one read.
If there is paired data (i.e. a forward reading and a backward reading), then the pair is divided in two rows.
Every row consists of at least 11 columns:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QNAME</span></code> Name of the query sequence.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FLAG</span></code> Bitwise flag.
This consists of twelve binary properties.
A read typically has multiple flags.
These flags are all then translated to a decimal number, given by the third column, and these decimal numbers are added up.
Typical values are 99, 147, 83 or 163.
To get a proper translation, use <a class="reference external" href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html">the SAM flag decoder</a>.
The following flags can be used:</p>

<h2>Determine essentiality based on transposon counts<a class="headerlink" href="#determine-essentiality-based-on-transposon-counts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using the number of transposons and reads, it can be determined which genes are potentially essential and which are not.
To check this method, the transposon count for wild type cells are determined.
Currently, genes that are taken as essential are the annotated essentials based on previous research (see files located in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">X:\tnw\BN\LL\Shared\Gregory\Gene_Database\</span></code>).</p>
<div class="section" id="distribution-number-of-insertions-and-reads-compared-with-essential-and-non-essential-genes">
<h3>Distribution number of insertions and reads compared with essential and non-essential genes<a class="headerlink" href="#distribution-number-of-insertions-and-reads-compared-with-essential-and-non-essential-genes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>(<em>See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">statistics_pergene.py</span></code></em>)</p>
<p>Ideally, the number of transposon insertions of all essential genes are small and the number of insertions in non-essential genes are is large so that there is a clear distinction can be made.
However, this is not always so clear.
For example, the distribution of transposons in WT cells in the data from Michel et. al. looks like this:</p>
<!-- ![Reads and transposon density after processing as discussed in Michel et.al. 2017.](./media/Tn_Reads_Pergene_BenoitAnalysis.png) -->
<p>In this figure, both the reads and the transposon counts are normalized with respect to the length of each gene (hence the graph represents the read density and transposon density).
High transposon counts only occurs for non-essential genes, and therefore when a high transposon count is seen, it can be assigned nonessential with reasonable certainty.
However, when the transposon count is low the there is a significant overlap between the two distributions and therefore there is no certainty whether this gene is essential or not (see also the section about ‘Interpreting Transposon Counts &amp; Reads’).</p>
<p>The data is also sensitive to postprocessing.
It is expected that the trimming of the sequences is an important step.
The graph below shows the same data as in the previous graph, but with different processing as is done by Michel et. al..
This has a significant influence on the results and as a consequence, no distinction can be made between essential and nonessential genes based on the transposon counts.
Significant attention needs to be given to the postprocessing of the data.</p>

<p>(<em>See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TransposonRead_Profile_Plot.py</span></code></em>)</p>
<p>To create a visual overview where the insertions are and how many reads there are for each insertion, a profile plot is created for each chromosome.</p>
<!-- ![Read profile plot for chromosome XV (note the y-axis is in logarithmic scale).](./media/Read_ProfilePlot_chrxv.png) -->
<p>The bars indicate the absolute number of reads for all insertions located in the bars (bar width is 545bp).
The colored background indicate the location of genes, where green are the annotated essential genes and red the non-essential genes.
In general, the essential genes have no or little reads whereas the non-essential genes have many reads.
Note that at location 564476 the ADE2 gene is located that has significant more reads than any other location in the genome, which has to do the way the plasmid is designed (see Michel et.al. 2017).
The examples used here are from a dataset discussed in the paper by Michel et.al. 2017 which used centromeric plasmids where the transposons are excised from.
The transposons tend to reinsert in the chromosome near the chromosomal pericentromeric region causing those regions to have about 20% more insertions compared to other chromosomal regions.</p>
<p>This figure gives a rough overview that allows for identifying how well the data fits the expectation.
Also an alternative version of this plot is made (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TransposonRead_Profile_Compare.py</span></code>) that makes a similar plot for two datasets at the same time, allowing the comparison of the two datasets with each other and with the expectation.</p>
<p><img alt="Comparison of the same datasets, but with different processing steps.

<h3>Profile plot number of reads per individual genes<a class="headerlink" href="#profile-plot-number-of-reads-per-individual-genes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>(<em>See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gene_reads.py</span></code></em>)</p>
<p>Instead of plotting the number of reads for an entire chromosome, it is also useful to plot the read profile for individual genes to see how the insertion sites and reads are distributed within a gene.
For this a bar plot is made where the number of reads per transposon are determined.
This also shows the distribution of the distances between subsequent transposon insertions for both the gene and the chromosome the gene is located.
It is expected that for essential genes, the median distance between subsequent insertions is larger compared to the distance in the entire chromosome (since important genes have few insertions and large parts will be free of insertions).
For non-essential genes, the distribution for the distance between insertions is expected to follow the distribution of the chromomsome more closely.</p>
<!-- ![Read per transposon insertion for BEM1. The violin plot gives the distribution for the distance between subsequent insertions for both BEM1 and chromosome II (where BEM1 is located). The small black bars indicate individual transposon insertions.](./media/Read_ProfilePlot_bem1.png) -->
<!-- ![Read per transposon insertion for the HO-locus. Note that the distribution for the distance between insertions follows the distribution for the chromosome more closely compared to BEM1.](./media/Read_ProfilePlot_ho.png) -->
<p>The minimum width of the bars are chosen such that each bar should contain 8 transposon insertions.
The maximum width is set equal to the length such that the probabilty of finding at least one insertion is more than 99% in the whole chromosome.
This is chosen because if now a bar is empty in a gene than this is not a coincidence, but this is an interesting region.</p>
<p>These plots can be used for checking if a gene has transposon free regions which might indicate that this gene is essential.</p>

The sequence reads from this file needs to be aligned to create a SAM file (and/or the compressed binary equivalent BAM file).

<h2>Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The results from the sequencing is typically represented in FASTA or FASTQ format.
This needs to be aligned according to a reference sequence to create a SAM and BAM file.
Before alignment, the data needs to be checked for quality and possibly trimmed to remove unwanted and unnecessary sequences.
When the location of the reads relative to a reference sequence are known, the insertion sites of the transposons can be determined.
With this, a visualization can be made that shows the number of transposon insertions per gene.</p>
<p>In the description given in this document, it is chosen to do the quality checking and the trimming in windows and the alignment of the reads with a reference genome in a virtual machine running Linux.
It is possible to do the quality checking and trimming in Linux as well or to do the whole process in windows.
To do quality checking and/or trimming in Linux requires more memory of the Linux machine since both the raw sequencing data needs to be stored and the trimming needs to be stored (both which can be relatively large files).
Since a virtual machine is used, both the computation power and the amount of storage is limited, and therefore it chosen to do the trimming on the main windows computer (this problem would not exists if a computer is used running on Linux, for example a computer with an alternative startup disc running Linux).
Sequence alignment can be done on Windows machines (e.g. using <a class="reference external" href="https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/">BBmap</a>), but this is not ideal as many software tools are designed for Unix based computer systems (i.e. Mac or Linux).
Also, many tools related to sequence alignment (e.g. converting .sam files to .bam and sorting and indexing the bam files) are done with tools not designed to be used in windows, hence this is performed in Linux.</p>
<p>An overview of the different processing steps are shown in the figure below.</p>
<!-- ![Processing pipeline. Input is a file containing the raw reads from the sequencing saved in a .fastq file.](./media/processing_pipeline.png) -->
<p>A short overview is given for different software tools that can be used for processing and analyzing the data.
Next, a step-by-step tutorial is given as an example how to process the data.
Most of this is done using command line based tools.</p>
<p>An overview of the different steps including some software that can handle this is shown here:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Checking the raw FASTA or FASTQ data can be done using the
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/"><strong>FASTQC</strong></a>) software (Windows, Linux, Mac. Requires Java).
This gives a quality report (see accompanying tutorial) for the sequence reads and can be run non-interactively using the command line.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the quality report, the data needs to be trimmed to remove any unwanted sequences.
This can be done with for example (<a class="reference external" href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html"><strong>FASTX</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac) or (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic"><strong>Trimmomatic</strong></a>) (Windows,requires Java).
An easy graphical user interface that combines the FASTQC and Trimmomatic is (<a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/project-123ngs/"><strong>123FASTQ</strong></a>).
Also <strong>BBDuk</strong> can be used for trimming (which belongs to BBMap).</p></li>
<li><p>The trimmed sequence reads need to be aligned using a reference
sequence, for example the <em>S. Cerevisiae</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/">S288C Ref64-2-1 reference sequence</a> or the <a class="reference external" href="http://sgd-archive.yeastgenome.org/sequence/strains/W303/W303_SGD_2015_JRIU00000000/">W303 reference sequence</a> from SGD.
Aligning can be done, for example, using (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.snapgene.com/"><strong>SnapGene</strong></a>) (Windows, Linux, Mac. This does not
import large files and is therefore not suitable for whole genome
sequencing), (<a class="reference external" href="https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/"><strong>BBMap</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac, Windows (seems to give problems when installing on windows machines), might be possible to integrate it in Python, (<a class="reference external" href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"><strong>BWA</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac), (<a class="reference external" href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml"><strong>Bowtie2</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac) or (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.clustal.org/omega/"><strong>ClustalOmega</strong></a>) (Windows, Linux, Mac).
This step might require defining scores for matches, mismatches, gaps and insertions of nucleotides.</p></li>
<li><p>After aligning, the data needs to be converted to SAM and BAM formats for easier processing hereafter.
This requires (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.htslib.org/"><strong>SAMtools</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac) or (<a class="reference external" href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us"><strong>GATK</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac).
Conversion from SAM to BAM can also be done in Matlab if preferred using the ‘BioMap’ function.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the BAM file with the aligned sequence reads, the transposon insertion sites can be determined using the <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/satayusers/"><strong>Matlab</strong> script given by Benoit Kornmann Lab</a> (including the name.mat and yeastGFF.mat files).
The results from this step are three files (a .txt file, a .bed file and a .wig file) that can be used for visualization.</p></li>
<li><p>If more processing is required, (<a class="reference external" href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/"><strong>Picard</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac) might be useful, as well as (<a class="reference external" href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us"><strong>GATK</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac).
Visualization of the genomic dataset can be done using (<a class="reference external" href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/home"><strong>IGV</strong></a>) (Windows, Linux, Mac) or SAMtools’ tview function.
Also (<a class="reference external" href="https://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/"><strong>sambamba</strong></a>) (Linux, Mac) can be used, especially for sorting and indexing the bam files.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating transposon insertion maps for the genome (see the <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/satayusers/">satay users website</a>) and comparison essential genes between different genetic backgrounds using Venn diagrams, customized software needs to be created.</p></li>

<h3>0. Initializing<a class="headerlink" href="#initializing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The steps discussed in this section are not obligatory, but might help in organizing the data.
The <strong>bold</strong> printed commands in this and the following sections are put so that they can be copied directly to the bash.
(Note to modify the respective paths on your own machine in this Initialization step, though).
If the paths below are correctly defined, the boldface commands defined in the different processing steps below can be literally copied and pasted in the bash.</p>
<p>Since this protocol works mostly in the Linux Virtual Machine, the commands below are defined for Linux.
First, a possible method for organizing the data is shown, but feel free to change this as you like.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create an empty datafolder.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the .fastq file to the datafolder.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the following empty folders for the outcomes of the different processing steps:</p>
<p>A. filename_QC</p>
<p>B. filename_Trimmed</p>
<p>C. filename_Aligned</p>
</li>
<li><p>When this is done in Windows, copy the datafolder to the shared folder for processing in the Virtual Machine using the commands (using git-bash)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#!/bin/bash</span></code></strong></p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pathwin_sharedfolder='/C/Users/gregoryvanbeek/Documents/</span> <span class="pre">VirtualBox</span> <span class="pre">VMs/</span> <span class="pre">VMSharedFolder_Ubuntu64_1'</span></code></strong></p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pathwin_data='C:\Users\gregoryvanbeek\Desktop\Cerevisiae_WT2_Seqdata_Michel2017\Cerevisiae_WT2_Seqdata_Michel2017_ProcessingTest'</span></code></strong></p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cp</span> <span class="pre">-r</span> <span class="pre">${pathwin_data}</span> <span class="pre">&quot;${pathwin_sharedfolder}&quot;</span></code></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The main processing is done in the Linux Virtual Machine.
Since the software tools are mostly commandline based, it might be convenient to be able to define variables, for example for the paths to the difference programs and files so that these do not have te be entered every single time.
For this start with the command that enables defining variables <strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#!/bin/bash</span></code></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the following variables. (copy paste the commands in the bash using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shift+Ins</span></code>. Remember to first alter the respective variables given below to the paths and filenames in your computer):</p>
<p>A. Path to the shared folder used for communicating with the virtual machine running Linux (<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">path_sf=/media/sf_VMSharedFolder_Ubuntu64_1/</span></code></strong>).</p>
<p>B. Name of the folder containing the data
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foldername='Cerevisiae_WT2_Seqdata_</span> <span class="pre">Michel2017_ProcessingTest'</span></code></strong>)</p>
<p>C. Name of the data file
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">filename='Cerevisiae_WT2_Michel2017.fastq'</span></code></strong>)</p>
<p>D. Name of the trimmed data file
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">filename_trimmed='Cerevisiae_WT2_Michel2017_trimmed.fastq'</span></code></strong>)</p>
<p>D. The processing can be performed in shared folder, but this is not recommended.
It is better to move the folder temporarily to the hard drive of the Virtual Machine.
For this define the location where the processing is performed (in this example located in the Documents directory)
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pathdata=~/Documents/data_processing/${foldername}</span></code></strong>)
If this directory does not already exists, create it using the command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mkdir</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}</span></code></p>
<p>E. Move the datafolder from shared folder to data processing folder
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mv</span> <span class="pre">${path_sf}${foldername}</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}</span></code></strong>)</p>
<p>F. Path to the location where the Trimmomatic software is located
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">path_trimm_software=~/Documents/</span> <span class="pre">Software/Trimmomatic-0.39/</span></code></strong>).</p>
<p>G. Path to the location where the BBDuk software is located
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">path_bbduk_software=~/Documents/</span> <span class="pre">Software/BBMap/bbmap/</span></code></strong>)</p>
<p>H. Path to the outcome folder for the fastqc software
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">path_fastqc_out=${pathdata}/</span> <span class="pre">Cerevisiae_WT2_Michel2017_QC/</span></code></strong>).</p>
<p>I. Path to the outcome folder for the trimmomatic software
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">path_trimm_out=${pathdata}/</span> <span class="pre">Cerevisiae_WT2_Michel2017_Trimmed/</span></code></strong>).</p>
<p>J. Path to the outcome folder for the aligned software
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">path_align_out=${pathdata}/</span> <span class="pre">Cerevisiae_WT2_Michel2017_Aligned/</span></code></strong>).</p>
<p>K. Path to the reference genome fasta file
(<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">path_refgenome=/home/gregoryvanbeek/Documents/</span>&#160; <span class="pre">Reference_Sequences/Reference_Sequence_S288C/S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa</span></code></strong>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some useful commands:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">echo</span></code>: Print a variable name or some text.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gunzip</span></code>: Unzip a .gz file.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bunzip</span></code>: Unzip a .bz file.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${}</span></code>: when using a variable, the name of the variable should be placed between curly brackets and should start with a dollar sign (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code>), otherwise the bash won’t recognize the name as a variable.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">less</span></code>: open the first few lines of a files that can be read as a text file.</p></li>
<li><p>When using or defining strings of texts, putting the string between accolades (‘’) tells the bash to take the text within the accolades literally.
Remember this when using the variables, as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'${var}'</span></code> is literally taken as the string <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({var} whereas when using `\)</span>{var}` (without accolades) the bash will try implement the variable ‘var’ depending on what you have defined before for this variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Copying texts in the bash does not work using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">crtl-v</span></code>, instead use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shift-Insert</span></code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>A suggestion is to put all the commands with the correct paths in a text file and store this text file together with the raw sequencing file (‘Linux_Processing_Commands.txt’ located at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Gregory94/LaanLab-SATAY-DataAnalysis/blob/dev_Gregory/docs/Linux_Processing_Commands.txt">SATAY github repository</a>).
The variables containing the paths and names in this file can be changed to point at the right files and directories in your computer.
Then all the commands can be easily copy-pasted in the bash and all the processing steps can be traced back later using this text file.</p>

<h3>1. Quality checking of the sequencing reads; FASTQC (0.11.9)<a class="headerlink" href="#quality-checking-of-the-sequencing-reads-fastqc-0-11-9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>FASTQC creates a report for the quality of sequencing data.
The input should be a fastq (both zipped and unzipped), sam or bam file (it can handle multiple files at once).
The program does not need to be installed, but after downloading only requires to be unzipped.
FASTQC can be ran as an interactive program (i.e. using a GUI) or non-interactively using the command line options.</p>
<p>If using interactively, open the ‘run_fastqc.bat’ file in the FASTQC folder and load a file to be checked. Alternatively using the 123FASTQ (version 1.1) program, open this and use the ‘Quality Check’ menu on the right.
The advantage of using 123FASTQ is that it can also do trimming (using Trimmomatic).</p>
<p>If using the command line for checking a single file use the command:</p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fastqc</span> <span class="pre">--outdir</span> <span class="pre">${path_fastqc_out}</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}/${filename}</span></code></strong></p>
<p>(Note that the output directory should already exist, as the program does not create directories).
In the output directory, a .html file and a (zipped) folder is created, both with the same name as the input file.
The .html file can be used to quickly see the graphs using a browser.
Also, a zipped folder is created where the raw data of the quality check is stored.
For explanation about the different graphs, see the fastqc_manual pdf or [<a class="reference external" href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/</a>] (or the paper ‘Preprocessing and Quality Control for Whole-Genome’ from Wright et.al. or the ‘Assessing Read Quality’ workshop from the Datacarpentry Genomics workshop).</p>
<p>For more commands, type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fastqc</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></code>.
Some useful commands might be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>–contaminants Reads a file where sequences are stored of (potential) contaminants.
The .txt-file should be created before running the software.
Each contaminant is presented on a different line the text file and should have the form name ‘tab’ sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>–adapters Similar as the contaminants command, but specifically for adapter sequences.
Also here a text file should be created before running and this file should have the same layout as the contaminants file.</p></li>
<li><p>–min_length where a minimal sequence length can be set, so that the statistics can be better compared between different reads of different length (which for example might occur after trimming).</p></li>
<li><p>–threads Preferably leave this unchanged, especially when an error is shown that there ‘could not reserve enough space for object heap’ after setting this command.</p></li>
<li><p>–extract Set this command (without following of parameters) to extract the zipped folder from the results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the FASTQC program is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Per base sequence quality</strong>: Box and whisker plot for the quality of a basepair position in all reads.
The quality should be above approximately 30 for most reads, but the quality typically drops near the end of the sequences.
If the ends of the reads are really bad, consider trimming those in the next step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Per tile sequence quality</strong>: (Shows only when Illumina Library which retains there sequence identifier).
Shows a heat map of the quality per tile of the sequence machines.
Blueish colours indicate that the quality score is about or better than average and reddish colours indicates scores worse than average.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Per sequence quality score</strong>: Shows an accumulative distribution to indicate which mean quality score per sequence occurs most often.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Per base sequence content</strong>: Shows the percentage of nucleotide appearance in all sequences.
Assuming a perfectly random distribution for all four nucleotides, each nucleotide should be present about 25% over the entire sequence. In the beginning this might be a bit off due to for example adapters present in the sequences.
If this is present, it might difficult/impossible to cut these during the trimming part, but it should typically not seriously affect further analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Per sequence GC content</strong>: Indicates the distribution of the G-C nucleotides appearances in the genome.
The ideal distribution that is expected based on the data is shown as a blue curve.
The red curve should, ideally follow the blue curve.
If the red curve is more or less a normal distribution, but shifted from the blue curve, is might indicate a systematic bias which might be caused by an inaccurate estimation of the GC content in the blue curve.
This does not necessarily indicate bad data.
When the red curve is not normal or show irregularities (peaks or flat parts), this might indicate contaminants in the sample or overrepresented sequences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Per base N content</strong>: Counts the number of N appearances in the data for each basepair position of all reads.
Every time a nucleotide cannot be accurately determine during sequencing, it is flagged with a N (No hit) in the sequence instead of one of the nucleotides.
Ideally this should never occur in the data and this graph should be a flat line at zero over the entire length.
Although at the end of the sequences it might occur few times, but it should not occur more than a few percent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sequence length distribution</strong>: Shows the length of all sequences.
Ideally all reads should have the same length, but this might change, for example, after trimming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sequence duplication level</strong>: Indicates how often some sequences appear the data.
Ideally, all reads occur only few times and a high peak is expected near 1.
If peaks are observed at higher numbers, this might indicate enrichment bias during the sequencing preparation (e.g. over amplification during PCR).
Only the first 100000 sequences are considered and when the length of the reads is over 75bp, the reads are cut down to pieces of 50bp.
Some duplication might not be bad and therefore a warning or error here does not need to concern.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overrepresented sequences</strong>: List of sequences that appear in more 0.1% of the total (this is only considered for the first 100000 sequences and reads over 75bp are truncated to 50bp pieces).
The program gives a warning (when sequences are found to be present between 0.1% and 1% of the total amount of sequences) or an error (when there are sequences occurring more 1% of all sequences), but this does not always mean that the data is bad and might be ignored.
For Illumina sequencing for satay experiments, the sequences often start with either ‘CATG’ or ‘GATC’ which are the recognition sites for NlaIII and DpnII respectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adapter content</strong>: Shows an accumulative percentage plot of repeated sequences with a positional bias appearing in the data.
So if many reads have the same sequence at (or near) the same location, then this might trigger a warning in this section.
Ideally this is a flat line at zero (meaning that there are no repeated sequences present in the data).
If this is not a flat line at zero, it might be necessary to cut the reported sequences during the trimming step.
If this section gives a warning, a list is shown with all the repeated sequences including some statistics.
It can be useful to delete these sequences in the trimming step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kmer content</strong>: indicates sequences with a position bias that are ofen repeated.
If a specific sequence occurs at the same location (i.e. basepair number) in many reads, then this module will show which sequence at which location turns up frequently.
Note that in later editions (0.11.6 and up) this module is by default turned off.
If you want to turn this module on again, go to the Configuration folder in the Fastqc folder and edit the limits.txt file in the line where it says ‘kmer  ignore  1’ and change the 1 in a 0.</p></li>

<h3>2. Trimming of the sequencing reads<a class="headerlink" href="#trimming-of-the-sequencing-reads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Next is the trimming of the sequencing reads to cut out, for example, repeated (adapter) sequences and low quality reads.
There are two software tools adviced, Trimmomatic and BBDuk.
Trimmomatic is relative simple to use and can be used interactively together with FASTQC.
However, the options can be limiting if you want more control over the trimming protocol.
An alternative is BBDuk, which is part of the BBMap software package.
This allows for more options, but can therefore also be more confusing to use initially.
Both software packages are explained below, but only one needs to be used.
Currently, it is advised to use BBDuk (see section 2b).</p>
<p>For a discussion about trimming, see for example the discussion in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2014.00013/full">MacManes et.al. 2014</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085024">Del Fabbro et.al. 2013</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/daa6/191f2a91a1bd5008f2bda068ae3f99ec85fd.pdf">Delhomme et. al. 2014</a> or at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.basepairtech.com/blog/trimming-for-rna-seq-data/#:~:text=Quality%20trimming%20decreases%20the%20overall,useful%20data%20for%20downstream%20analyses.&amp;text=Too%20aggressive%20quality%20trimming%20can,%2C%20estimation%20of%20gene%20expression">basepairtech.com</a> (although this discussion is on RNA, similar arguments hold for DNA sequence analysis).</p>
<div class="section" id="a-trimming-of-the-sequencing-reads-trimmomatic-0-39">
<h4>2a. Trimming of the sequencing reads; Trimmomatic (0.39)<a class="headerlink" href="#a-trimming-of-the-sequencing-reads-trimmomatic-0-39" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Trimmomatic alters the sequencing result by trimming the reads from unwanted sequences, as is specified by the user.
The program does not need to be installed, but after downloading only requires to be unzipped.
Trimmomatic can be ran as an interactive program (for this 123FASTQ needs to be used) or non-interactively using the command line options.</p>
<p>If using interactively, use 123FASTQ (version 1.1) and run the ‘Runner.bat’ file in the 123FASTQ folder.
Use the ‘Trimmer’ in the ‘Trim Factory’ menu on the right.</p>
<p>If using non-interactively in the command line use the command:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">java</span> <span class="pre">-jar</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_software}'trimmomatic-0.39.jar'</span></code></p>
<p>Before running Trimmomatic, a .fasta file needs to be created that allows clipping unwanted sequences in the reads.
For example, the ‘overrepresented sequences’ as found by Fastqc can be clipped by adding the sequences to the .fasta file.
Easiest is to copy an existing .fasta file that comes with Trimmomatic and adding extra sequences that needs to be clipped.
For MiSeq sequencing, it is advised to use the TruSeq3 adapter file that needs to be copied to the data folder (see below for detailed explanation).
For this use the command:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cp</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_software}'adapters/''TruSeq3-SE.fa'</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}</span></code></p>
<p>Open the .fa file and copy any sequences in the file using a similar style as the sequences that are already present.
Typically it is useful to clip overrepresented sequences that start with ‘CATG’ or ‘GATC’ which are the recognition sites for NlaIII and DpnII respectively.
Note that the trimming is performed in the order in which the steps are given as input.
Typically the adapter clipping is performed as one of the first steps and removing short sequences as one of the final steps.</p>
<p>A typical command for trimmomatic looks like this:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">java</span> <span class="pre">-jar</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_software}'trimmomatic-0.39.jar'</span> <span class="pre">SE</span> <span class="pre">-phred33</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}${filename}</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_out}${filename_trimmed}</span> <span class="pre">ILLUMINACLIP:'TruSeq3-SE.fa':2:30:10</span> <span class="pre">LEADING:14</span> <span class="pre">TRAILING:14</span> <span class="pre">SLIDINGWINDOW:10:14</span> <span class="pre">MINLEN:30</span></code></p>
<p>Check the quality of the trimmed sequence using the command:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${path_fastqc_software}fastqc</span> <span class="pre">--outdir</span> <span class="pre">${path_fastqc_out}</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_out}${filename_trimmed}</span></code></p>
<p>The following can be set to be set by typing the following fields after the above command (the fields must be in the given order, the optional fields can be ignored if not needed, see also <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic">http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SE</span></code> (Single End) or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PE</span></code> (Paired End) [required];</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-phred33</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-phred64</span></code> sets which quality coding is used, if not specified the program tries to determine this itself which might be less accurate.
usually the phred33 coding is used.
If not sure, check if the .fastq file contains, for example, an exclamation mark (!), a dollar sign ($), an ampersand (&amp;) or any number (0-9) since these symbols only occur in the phredd33 coding and not in the phred64 coding [optional];</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Input</span> <span class="pre">filename</span></code>. Both forward and reverse for paired end in case of PE [required];</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Output</span> <span class="pre">filename</span></code>. Both paired and unpaired forward and paired and unpaired reverse for paired end (thus 4 output in total) in case of PE.
In case of SE, a single output file needs to be specified.
Needs to have the same extension as the input file (e.g. .fastq) [required];</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-SE.fa:2:15</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10</span></code> (for Single End reads or Paired End reads respectively). This cuts the adapter and other Illumina specific sequences from the reads.
The first parameter after <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:</span></code> indicates a FASTA file (this should be located in the same folder as the sequencing data).
The second paramter indicates the Seed Mismatches which indicates the maximum mismatch count that still allows for a full match to be performed.
The third parameter (for SE, fourth parameter for PE) is the Simple Clip Threshold which specifies how accurate the match between the adapter and the read.
The third parameter for PE sets the Palindrome Clip Threshold specifies how accurate the match between the two ‘adapter
ligated’ reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of adapters are stored in the ‘adapters’ folder at the location where the trimmomatic program is saved.
In case of MiSeq sequencing, the TruSeq3 adapter file is advised.
The way the adapter sequences are aligned is by cutting the adapters (in the FASTA file) into 16bp pieces (called seeds) and these seeds are aligned to the reads.
If there is a match, the entire alignment between the read and the complete adapter sequence is given a score.
A perfect match gets a score of 0.6.
Each mismatching base reduces the score by Q/10.
When the score exceeds a threshold, the adapter is clipped from the read. The first number in the parameter gives the maximal number of mismatches allowed in the seeds (typically 2).
The second value is the minimal score before the adapter is clipped (typically between 7 (requires <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{7}{0.6}=12\)</span> perfect matches) and 15 (requires <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{15}{0.6}=25\)</span> perfect matches)).
High values for short reads (so many perfect matches are needed) allows for clipping adapters, but not for adapter contaminations.
Note a bug in the software is that the FASTA file with the adapters need to be located in your current folder.
A path to another folder with the adapter files yields an error. [optional] [<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.bits.vib.be/index.php/Parameters_of_Trimmomatic">https://wiki.bits.vib.be/index.php/Parameters_of_Trimmomatic</a>];</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SLIDINGWINDOW</span></code> Sliding window trimming which cuts out sequences witin the window and all the subsequent basepairs in the read if the average quality score within the window is lower than a certain threshold.
The window moves from the 5’-end to the 3’-end.
Note that if the first few reads of a sequence if of low quality, but the remaining of the sequence is of high quality, the entire sequence will be removed just because of the first few bad quality nucleotides.
If this sitatuation occurs, it might be useful to first apply the HEADCROP option (see below).
Parameters should be given as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SLIDINGWINDOW:L_window:Q_min</span></code> where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L_window</span></code> is the window size (in terms of basepairs) and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Q_min</span></code> the average threshold quality.

</ul>
<p>Note that the input files can be either uncompressed FASTQ files or gzipped FASTQ (with an extension fastq.gz or fq.gz) and the output fields should ideally have the same extension as the input files (i.e. .fastq or .fq).
The convention is using field:parameter, where ‘parameter’ is typically a number.

Trimmomatic can only run a single file at the time.

<h4>2b. Trimming of the sequencing reads; BBDuk (38.84)<a class="headerlink" href="#b-trimming-of-the-sequencing-reads-bbduk-38-84" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>BBDuk is part of the BBMap package and alters the sequencing result by trimming the reads from unwanted sequences, as is specified by the user.
The program does not need to be installed, but after downloading only requires to be unzipped.</p>
<p>Before running BBDuk, a .fasta file can to be created that allows clipping unwanted sequences in the reads.
For example, the ‘overrepresented sequences’ as found by Fastqc can be clipped by adding the sequences to the .fasta file.
A .fasta file can be created by simply creating a text file and adding the sequences that need to be clipped, for example, in the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&gt; Sequence1</p>
<p>CATG</p>
<p>&gt; Sequence2</p>
<p>GATC</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Or a .fasta can be copied from either Trimmomatic software package or the BBDuk package, both which are provided with some standard adapter sequences.
In the case of Trimmomatic it is advised to use the TruSeq3 adapter file when using MiSeq sequencing.
To copy the .fasta file to the data folder (see below for detailed explanation) use the following command:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cp</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_software}'adapters/''TruSeq3-SE.fa'</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}</span></code></p>
<p>When using the adapter file that comes with BBMap, use the command:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cp</span> <span class="pre">${path_bbduk_software}'resources/adapters.fa'</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}</span></code></p>
<p>The adapters.fa file from the BBDuk package includes many different adapter sequences, so it might be good to remove everything that is not relevant.
One option can be to create a custom fasta file where all the sequences are placed that need to be trimmed and save this file in the bbmap/resources folder.
To do this, in order to let everything work properly it is best to alter one of the existing .fa files.
First copy that file as a backup using a different name (e.g. in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#{path_bbduk_software}/resources</span></code> directory type the command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cp</span> <span class="pre">adapters.fa</span> <span class="pre">adapters_original_backup.fa</span></code>).
Then, alter the adapters.fa file with any sequences you want to get trimmed.
Note to not put empty lines in the text file, otherwise BBDuk might yield an error about not finding the adapters.fa file.</p>
<p>Typically it is useful to clip overrepresented sequences that were found by FASTQC and sequences that start with ‘CATG’ or ‘GATC’ which are the recognition sites for NlaIII and DpnII respectively.
Note that the trimming is performed in the order in which the steps are given as input.
Typically the adapter clipping is performed as one of the first steps and removing short sequences as one of the final steps.</p>
<p>BBDuk uses a kmers algorithm, which basically means it divides the reads in pieces of length k.
(For example, the sequence ‘abcd’ has the following 2mers: ab,bc,cd).
For each of these pieces the software checks if it contains any sequences that are present in the adapter file.
The kmers process divides both the reads and the adapters in pieces of length k and it then looks for an exact match.
If an exact match is found between a read and an adapter, then that read is trimmed.
If the length k is chosen to be bigger than the length of the smallest adapter, then there will never be an exact match between any of the reads and the adapter sequence and the adapter will therefore never be trimmed.
However, when the length k is too small the trimming might be too specific and it might trim too many reads.
Typically, the length k is chosen about the size of the smallest adapter sequence or slighty smaller.
For more details, see <a class="reference external" href="https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/">this webpage</a>.</p>
<p>A typical command for BBDuk looks like this:
<strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${path_bbduk_software}/bbduk.sh</span> <span class="pre">-Xmx1g</span> <span class="pre">in=${pathdata}/${filename}</span> <span class="pre">out=${path_trimm_out}${filename_trimmed}</span> <span class="pre">ref=${path_bbduk_software}</span> <span class="pre">/resources/adapters.fa</span> <span class="pre">ktrim=r</span> <span class="pre">k=23</span> <span class="pre">mink=10</span> <span class="pre">hdist=1</span> <span class="pre">qtrim=r</span> <span class="pre">trimq=14</span> <span class="pre">minlen=30</span></code></strong></p>
<p>Next an overview is given with some of the most useful options.
For a full overview use call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bbduk.sh</span></code> in the bash without any options.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-Xmx1g</span></code>. This defines the memory usage of the computer, in this case 1Gb (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1g</span></code>).
Setting this too low or too high can result in an error (e.g. ‘Could not reserve enough space for object heap’).
Depending on the maximum memory of your computer, setting this to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1g</span></code> should typically not result in such an error.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">out</span></code>. Input and Output files.
For paired-end sequencing, use also the commands <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in2</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">out2</span></code>.
The input accepts zipped files, but make sure the files have the right extension (e.g. file.fastq.gz).
Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">outm</span></code> (and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">outm2</span></code> when using paired-end reads) to also save all reads that failed to pass the trimming.
Note that defining an absolute path for the path-out command does not work properly.
Best is to simply put a filename for the file containing the trimmed reads which is then stored in the same directory as the input file and then move this trimmed reads file to any other location using:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mv</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}${filename::-6}_trimmed.fastq</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_out}</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qin</span></code>. Set the quality format.
33 for phred 33 or 64 for phred 64 or auto for autodetect (default is auto).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ref</span></code>. This command points to a .fasta file containg the adapters.
This should be stored in the location where the other files are stored for the BBDuk software (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${path_bbduk_software}/resources</span></code>)
Next are a few commands relating to the kmers algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ktrim</span></code>. This can be set to either don’t trim (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code>, default), right trimming (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code>), left trimming (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l</span></code>).
Basically, this means what needs to be trimmed when an adapter is found, where right trimming is towards the 5’-end and left trimming is towards the 3’-end.
For example, when setting this option to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ktrim=r</span></code>, then when a sequence is found that matches an adapter sequence, all the basepairs on the right of this matched sequence will be deleted including the matched sequence itself.
When deleting the whole reads, set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ktrim=rl</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kmask</span></code>. Instead of trimming a read when a sequence matches an adapter sequence, this sets the matching sequence to another symbol (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kmask=N</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">k</span></code>. This defines the number of kmers to be used. This should be not be longer than the smallest adapter sequences and should also not be too short as there might too much trimmed. Typically values around 20 works fine (default=27).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mink</span></code>. When the lenght of a read is not a perfect multiple of the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">k</span></code>, then at the end of the read there is a sequence left that is smaller than length k. Setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mink</span></code> allows the software to use smaller kmers as well near the end of the reads.
The sequence at the end of a read are matched with adapter sequences using kmers with length between mink and k.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minkmerhits</span></code>. Determines how many kmers in the read must match the adapter sequence.
Default is 1, but this can be increased when for example using short kmers to decrease the chance that wrong sequences are trimmed that happen to have a single matching kmer with an adapter.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minkmerfraction</span></code>. A kmer in this read is considered a match with an adapter when at least a fraction of the read matches the adapter kmer.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mincovfraction</span></code>. At least a fraction of the read needs to match adapter kmer sequences in order to be regarded a match.
Use either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minkmerhits</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minkmerfraction</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mincovfraction</span></code>, but setting multiple results in that only one of them will be used during the processing.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hdist</span></code>. This is the Hamming distance, which is defined as the minimum number of substitutions needed to convert one string in another string.
Basically this indicates how many errors are allowed between a read and and an adapter sequence to still count as an exact match.
Typically does not need to be set any higher than 1, unless the reads are of very low quality.
Note that high values of hdist also requires much more memory in the computer.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">restrictleft</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">restrictright</span></code>. Only look for kmers left or right number bases.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tpe</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tbo</span></code>: This is only relevant for paired-end reads.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tpe</span></code> cuts both the forward and the reverse read to the same length and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tbo</span></code> trims the reads if they match any adapter sequence while considering the overlap between two paired reads.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So far all the options were regarding the adapter trimming (more options are available as well, check out the <a class="reference external" href="https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/">user guide</a>).
These options go before any other options, for example the following:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qtrim</span></code>. This an option for quality trimming which indicates whether the reads should be trimmed on the right (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code>), the left (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l</span></code>), both (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fl</span></code>), neither (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code>) or that a slidingwindow needs to be used (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">w</span></code>).
The threshold for the trimming quality is set by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trimq</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trimq</span></code>. This sets the minimum quality that is still allowed using phred scores (e.g. Q=14 corresponds with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{error} = 0.04\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minlength</span></code>. This sets the minimum length that the reads need to have after all previous trimming steps.
Reads short than the value given here are discarded completely.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mlf</span></code>. Alternatively to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minlen</span></code> option, the Minimum Length Fraction can be used which determines the fraction of the length of the read before and after trimming and if this drops below a certain value (e.g 50%, so <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mlf=50</span></code>), then this read is trimmed.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">maq</span></code>. Discard reads that have an average quality below the specified Q-value.
This can be useful after quality trimming to discard reads where the really poor quality basepairs are trimmed, but the rest of the basepairs are of poor quality as well.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ftl</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ftr</span></code> (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forcetrimleft</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forcetrimright</span></code>). This cuts a specified amount of basepairs at the beginning (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ftl</span></code>) or the last specified amount of basepairs (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ftr</span></code>).
Note that this is zero based, for example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ftl=10</span></code> trims basepairs 0-9.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ftm</span></code>. This force Trim Modulo option can sometimes be useful when an extra, unwanted and typically very poor quality, basepair is added at the end of a read.
So when reads are expected to be all 75bp long, this will discard the last basepair in 76bp reads.
When such extra basepairs are present, it will be noted in FastQC.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, to check the quality of the trimmed sequence using the command:</p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fastqc</span> <span class="pre">--outdir</span> <span class="pre">${path_fastqc_out}</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_out}/${filename_trimmed}</span></code></strong></p>

<h3>3. Sequence alignment and Reference sequence indexing; BWA (0.7.17) (Linux)<a class="headerlink" href="#sequence-alignment-and-reference-sequence-indexing-bwa-0-7-17-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The alignment can be completed using different algorithms within BWA, but the ‘Maximal Exact Matches’ (MEM) algorithm is the recommended one (which is claimed to be the most accurate and fastest algorithm and is compatible with many downstream analysis tools, see <a class="reference external" href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml">documentation</a> for more information).
BWA uses a FM-index, which uses the Burrows Wheeler Transform (BWT), to exactly align all the reads to the reference genome at the same time.
Each alignment is given a score, based on the number of matches, mismatches and potential gaps and insertions.
The highest possible score is 60, meaning that the read aligns perfectly to the reference sequence (this score is saved in the SAM file as MAPQ).
Besides the required 11 fields in the SAM file, BWA gives some optional fields to indicate various aspects of the mapping, for example the alignment score (for a complete overview and explanation, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml">documentation</a>).
The generated SAM file also include headers where the names of all chromosomes are shown (lines starting with SQ).
These names are used to indicate where each read is mapped to.</p>
<p>Before use, the reference sequence should be indexed so that the program knows where to find potential alignment sites.
This only has to be done <em>once</em> for each reference genome.
Index the reference genome using the command</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bwa</span> <span class="pre">index</span> <span class="pre">/path/to/reference/sequence/file.fasta</span></code></p>
<p>This creates 5 more files in the same folder as the reference genome that BWA uses to speed up the process of alignment.</p>
<p>The alignment command should be given as</p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bwa</span> <span class="pre">mem</span> <span class="pre">[options]</span> <span class="pre">${path_refgenome}</span> <span class="pre">${path_trimm_out}${filename_trimmed}</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">${path_align_out}</span> <span class="pre">${filename_trimmed::-6}'.sam'</span></code></strong></p>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[options]</span></code> can be different statements as given in the
documentation. Most importantly are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-A</span></code> Matching scores (default is 1)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-B</span></code> Mismatch scores (default is 4)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-O</span></code> Gap open penalty (default is 6)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-E</span></code> Gap extension penalty (default is 1)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-U</span></code> Penalty for unpaired reads (default is 9; only of use in case of paired-end sequencing).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this process might take a while.
After BWA is finished, a new .sam file is created in the same folder as the .fastq file.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a .bam file using the command</p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">samtools</span> <span class="pre">view</span> <span class="pre">–b</span> <span class="pre">${path_align_out}${filename_trimmed::-6}'.sam'</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">${path_align_out}</span> <span class="pre">${filename_trimmed::-6}'.bam'</span></code>.</strong></p>
<p>Check if everything is ok with the .bam file using</p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">samtools</span> <span class="pre">quickcheck</span> <span class="pre">${path_align_out}${filename_trimmed::-6}'.bam'</span></code></strong>.</p>
<p>This checks if the file appears to be intact by checking the header is valid, there are sequences in the beginning of the file and that there is a valid End-Of_File command at the end.
It thus check only the beginning and the end of the file and therefore any errors in the middle of the file are not noted.
But this makes this command really fast.
If no output is generated, the file is good.
If desired, more information can be obtained using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">samtools</span> <span class="pre">flagstat</span> <span class="pre">${path_align_out}${filename_trimmed::-6}'.bam'</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">samtools</span> <span class="pre">stats</span> <span class="pre">${path_align_out}${filename_trimmed::-6}'.bam'</span></code>.
Especially the latter can be a bit overwhelming with data, but this gives a thorough description of the quality of the bam file.
For more information see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.htslib.org/doc/1.6/samtools.html">this documentation</a>.</p>
<p>For many downstream tools, the .bam file needs to be sorted.
This can be done using SAMtools, but this might give problems.
A faster and more reliable method is using the software sambamba using the command</p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sambamba-0.7.1-linux-static</span> <span class="pre">sort</span> <span class="pre">–m</span> <span class="pre">500MB</span> <span class="pre">${path_align_out}${filename_trimmed::-6}'.bam'</span></code></strong></p>
<p>(where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">–m</span></code> allows for specifying the memory usage which is 500MB in this example).
This creates a file with the extension .sorted.bam, which is the sorted version of the original bam file.
Also an index is created with the extension .bam.bai.
If this latter file is not created, it can be made using the command</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sambamba-0.7.1-linux-static</span> <span class="pre">index</span>&#160; <span class="pre">${path_align_out}${filename_trimmed::-6}'.bam'</span></code>.</p>
<p>Now the reads are aligned to the reference genome and sorted and indexed.
Further analysis is done in windows, meaning that the sorted .bam files needs to be moved to the shared folder.</p>
<p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mv</span> <span class="pre">${pathdata}</span> <span class="pre">${path_sf}</span></code></strong></p>
<p>Next, the data analysis is performed using custom made codes in Matlab in Windows.</p>

<p>The Matlab code is provided by Benoit (see the <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/satayusers/complete-protocol/bioinformatics-analysis/matlab-script">website</a>) and is based on the <a class="reference external" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/23570">paper by Michel et. al.</a>.
Running the code requires the user to select a .bam  or .sorted.bam file (or .ordered.bam which is similar to the .sorted.bam).
If the .bam file is chosen or there is no .bam.bai (bam index-)file present in the same folder, the script will automatically generate the .sorted.bam and a .bam.bai file.
In the same folder as the bam file the Matlab variables ‘yeastGFF.mat’ and ‘names.mat’ should be present (which can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/satayusers/complete-protocol/bioinformatics-analysis/matlab-script">website cited above</a>).
The script will generate a number of files (some of them are explained below):</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>.sorted.bam (if not present already)</p></li>
<li><p>.bam.bai (if not present already)</p></li>
<li><p>.sorted.bam.linearindex</p></li>
<li><p>.sorted.bam.mat (used as a backup of the matlab script results)</p></li>
<li><p>.sorted.bam_pergene.txt (contains information about transposons and reads for individual genes)</p></li>
<li><p>.sorted.bam.bed (contains information about the location and the number of reads per transposon insertion)</p></li>
<li><p>.sorted.bam.wig (contains information about the location and the number of reads per transposon insertion)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The line numbers below correspond to the original, unaltered code.</p>
<p>[line1-13] After loading the .BAM file, the ‘baminfo’ command is used
to collect the properties for the sequencing data. These include (among
others) [<a class="reference external" href="https://nl.mathworks.com/help/bioinfo/ref/baminfo.html">https://nl.mathworks.com/help/bioinfo/ref/baminfo.html</a>]:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SequenceDictionary</span></code>: Includes the number of basepairs per
chromosome.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ScannedDictionary</span></code>: Which chromosomes are read (typically 16 and
the mitochondrial chromosome).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ScannedDictionaryCount</span></code>: Number of reads aligned to each reference
sequence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>[line22-79] Then, a for-loop over all the chromosomes starts (17 in
total, 16 chromosomes and a mitochondrial chromosome). The for-loop
starts with a BioMap command which gets the columns of the SAM-file. The
size of the columns corresponds with the number of reads aligned to each
reference sequence (see also the ‘baminfo’ field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ScannedDictionaryCount</span></code>). The collected information is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SequenceDictionary</span></code>: Chromosome number where the reads are
collected for (given in roman numerals or ‘Mito’ for mitochondrial).
(QNAME)</p></li>

represents an error probability for a base pair in a read. See

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sequence</span></code>: Nucleotide sequence of the read. Length should math the

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Header</span></code>: Associated header for each read sequence.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Nseqs</span></code>: Integer indicating the number of read sequences for the

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Name</span></code>: empty</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: Similar information can be obtained using the ‘bamread’ command
(although his is slower than ‘BioMap’), which gives a structure element
with fields for each piece of information. This can be accessed using:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bb</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">bamread(file,infobam.SequenceDictionary(kk).SequenceName,\[1</span> <span class="pre">infobam.SequenceDictionary(kk).SequenceLength\]))</span></code>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bb(x).’FIELD’</span> <span class="pre">%where</span> <span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">row</span> <span class="pre">(i.e.</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">specific</span> <span class="pre">read)</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">FIELD</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">string</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">field.</span></code>)</p>
<p>After extracting the information from the SAM-file (using the ‘BioMap’
command), the starting site is defined for each read. This is depended
on the orientation of the read sequence. If this is normal orientation
it has flag=0, if it is in reverse orientation it has flag=16. If the
read sequence is in reverse orientation, the length of the read sequence
(‘readlength’ variable) needs to be added to the starting site (‘start’
variable). The corrected starting sites of all reads are saved in a new
variable (‘start2’). Note that this changes the order of which the reads
are stored. To correct this, the variables ‘start2’ and ‘flag2’ are
sorted in ascending order.</p>
<p>Now, all the reads in the current chromosome are processed. Data is
stored in the ‘’tncoordinates’ variable. This consists of three numbers;
the chromosome number (‘kk’), start position on the chromosome
(‘start2’) and the flag (‘flag2’). All reads that have the same
starting position and the same flag (i.e. the same reading orientation)
are stored as a single row in the ‘tncoordinates’ variable (for this the
average starting position is taken). This results in an array where each
row indicates a new starting position and the reading orientation. The
number of measurements that were averaged for a read is stored in the
variable ‘readnumb’. This is important later in the program for
determining the transposons.</p>
<p>This is repeated for each chromosome due to the initial for-loop. The
‘tnnumber’ variable stores the number of unique starting positions and
flags for each chromosome (this does not seem to be used anywhere else
in the program).</p>
<p>[line94-120] After getting the needed information from the SAM-file,
the data needs to be compared with the literature. For this yeastGFF.mat
is used (provided by Benoit et. al.) that loads the variable ‘gff’. This
includes all genes (from SGD) and the essential genes (from YeastMine).
(Note that a similar list can be downloaded from the SGD website as a
text file). The file is formatted as a matrix with in each row a DNA
element (e.g. genes) and each column represent a different piece of
information about that element. The used columns are:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Chromosome number (represented as roman numerals)</p></li>
<li><p>Data source (either SGD, YeastMine or landmark. Represented as a
string)</p></li>
<li><p>Type of the DNA element, e.g. gene. The first element of a
chromosome is always the ‘omosome’, which is the entire chromosome
(Represented as a string)</p></li>
<li><p>Start coordinates (in terms of base pairs. Represented as an
integer)</p></li>
<li><p>End coordinates (in terms of base pairs. Represented as an integer)</p></li>
<li><p>A score value. Always a ‘.’ Represented as a string indicating a
dummy value.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading direction (+ for forward reading (5’-3’), - for reverse
reading (3’-5’), ‘.’ If reading direction is undetermined.
Represented as a string)</p></li>
<li><p>Always a ‘.’ Except when the element is a Coding DNA Sequence (CDS),
when this column become a ‘0’. A CDS always follows a gene in the
list and the value indicates how many basepairs should be removed
from the beginning of this feature in order to reach the first codon
in the next base (Represented as a string)</p></li>
<li><p>Other information and notes (Represented as a string)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From the ‘gff’ variable, all the genes are searched and stored in the
variable ‘features.genes’ (as a struct element). The same thing is done
for the essential genes by searching for genes from the ‘YeastMine’
library and these are stored in ‘features.essential’ (as a struct
element). This results in three variables:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">features</span></code>: struct element that includes the fields ‘genes’ and
‘essential’ that include numbers representing in which rows of the
‘gff’ variable the (essential) gene can be found (note that the
essential genes are indicated by ‘ORF’ from ’Yeastmine’ in the ‘gff’
variable).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">genes</span></code>: struct element storing the start and end coordinates (in
basepairs) and the chromosome number where the gene is found.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">essential</span></code>: struct element. Same as ‘genes’, but then for essential
genes as found by the ‘YeastMine’ database.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This can be extended with other features (e.g. rRNA, see commented out
sections in the code).</p>
<p>[line124-160] Next all the data is stored as if all the chromosomes
are put next to each other. In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tncoordinates</span></code> variable, for each
chromosome the counting of the basepairs starts at 1. The goal of this
section is to continue counting such that the first basepair number of a
chromosome continues from the last basepair number of the previous
chromosome (i.e. the second chromosome is put after the first, the third
chromosome is put after the second etc., to create one very long
chromosome spanning the entire DNA). The first chromosome is skipped
(i.e. the for-loop starts at 2) because these basepairs does not need to
be added to a previous chromosome. This is repeated for the start and
end coordinates of the (essential) genes.</p>
<p>[line162-200] Now the number of transposons is determined which is
done by looking at the number of reads per gene. First, all the reads
are found that have a start position between the start and end position
of the known genes. The indices of those reads are stored in the
variable ‘xx’. In the first for-loop of the program (see lines 22-79)
the reads (or measurements) that had the same starting position and flag
where averaged and represented as a single read. To get the total number
of reads per gene the number of measurements that were used for
averaging the reads corresponding to the indices in ‘xx’ are summed (the
value stored in the variable ‘readnumb’). This is repeated for all genes
and the essential genes using a for-loop. The maximum value is
subtracted as a feature to suppress noise or unmeaningful data (see a
more detailed explanation the discussion by Galih in the forum of Benoit [<a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21category-topic/satayusers/bioinformatics/uaTpKsmgU6Q">https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21category-topic/satayusers/bioinformatics/uaTpKsmgU6Q</a>]).</p>
<p>[line226-227] Next all variables in the Matlab workspace are saved
using the same name as the .bam file, but now with the .mat extension.
The program so far does not need to be ran all over again but loading
the .mat file loads all the variables.</p>
<p>Next a number of files are generated (.bed, .txt and .wig).</p>
<p>[line238-256] A .bed file is generated that can be used for
visualization of the read counts per insertion site. This contains
the information stored in the ‘tncoordinates’ variable. This includes
the chromosome number and the start position of the reads. The end
position of the reads is taken as the start position +1 (The end
position is chosen like this just to visualize the transposon insertion
site). The third column is just a dummy variable and can be ignored. As
the reads were averaged if multiple reads shared the same location on
the genome, the total number of reads is taken from the ‘readnumb’
variable and is stored in the fourth column of the file using the
equation 100+readnumb(i)*20 (e.g. a value of 4 in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">readnumb</span></code> is stored as 180 in the .bed file).</p>
<p>In general a .bed file can contain 12 columns, but only the first three
columns are obligatory. These are the chromosome number, start position
and end position (in terms of basepairs), respectively. More information
can be added as is described in the links below. If a column is filled,
then all the previous columns need to be filled as well. If this
information is not present or wanted, the columns can be filled with a
dummy character (typically a dot is used) [<a class="reference external" href="https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html">https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html</a>] [<a class="reference external" href="https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/ngs-file-formats/bed-format/">https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/ngs-file-formats/bed-format/</a>].</p>
<p>[line238-256] Next a text file is generated for storing information
about the transposon counts per gene. This is therefore a summation of
all the transposons that have an insertion site within the gene. (To
check a value in this file, look up the location of a gene present in
this file. Next look how many transposon are located within the range
spanned by the gene using the .bed file). To create this the names.mat
file is needed to create a list of gene names present in the first
column. The transposon count is taken from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tnpergene</span></code> variable and
is stored in the second column of the file. The third is the number of
reads per gene which is taken from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">readpergene</span></code> variable (which is
calculated by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">readnumb-max(readnumb)</span></code> where the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">readnumb</span></code> variable is
used for keeping track of the number of reads that were used to average
the reads).</p>
<p>[line260-299] Creating a .wig file. This indicates the transposon
insertion sites (in terms of basepairs, starting counting from 1 for
each new chromosome). The file consists of two columns. The first column
represent the insertion site for each transposons and the second column
is the number of reads in total at that location. The
information is similar to that found in the .bed file, but here the
read count is the actual count (and thus not used the equation
100+transposon_count*20 as is done in the .bed file).</p>
